## Content

This is the **latest** available documentation of the IFC 4.3.2.0 specification. 
The structure and semantic contents of this are **[exactly the same as the ISO IFC 4.3](https://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4_3/)** but with additional examples and clarrifications in the documentation. It may also contain typo fixes.
This is a further elaboration of the ISO release without changes to the schema and specification.
