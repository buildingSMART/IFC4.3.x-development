# Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see [www.iso.org/directives](http://www.iso.org/directives)).

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or on the ISO list of patent declarations received (see [www.iso.org/patents](http://www.iso.org/patents)).

For an explanation of the voluntary nature of standards, the meaning of ISO specific terms and expressions related to conformity assessment, as well as information about ISO's adherence to the World Trade Organization (WTO) principles in the Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) see [www.iso.org/iso/foreword.html](http://www.iso.org/iso/foreword.html).

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 59, *Buildings and civil engineering works, SC 13, Organization and digitization of information about buildings and civil engineering works, including building information modelling (BIM)*.

This edition cancels and replaces ISO 16739:2018 which had been enhanced in scope, technically revised, and restructured. The main changes are:
- The addition of semantic constructs for project and spatial structures used in infrastructure and civil engineering works
- The addition of semantic constructs for construction elements used in infrastructure and civil engineering works
- The revision of semantic constructs for building engineering works
- The inclusion of geometric transition curves for the purpose of infrastructure alignment curve definitions
- New type of placement to position elements along such alignment curves 
- New types of geometric models and revision of existing geometric models to allow the sweeping of curves and surfaces along such alignment curves
- Removal of semantic constructs that had been deprecated in ISO 16739-1:2018
- Deprecation of semantic constructs considered for removal in future versions of this standard

A complete list of all changes is provided in Annex F 'Change logs’.

ISO 16739-1 is currently the only part of the ISO 16739 series published.

Any feedback or questions on this document should be directed to the user's national standards body. A complete listing of these bodies can be found at [www.iso.org/members.html](http://www.iso.org/members.html).
