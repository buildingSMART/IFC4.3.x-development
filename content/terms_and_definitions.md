For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply.

## 3.1.1 actor
person, an organization, or person acting on behalf of an organization

> NOTE A specialization of the general term object.

## 3.1.2 attribute
unit of information within an entity, defined by a particular type or reference to a particular entity

> NOTE There are three kinds of attributes: direct attributes, inverse attributes and derived attributes.

## 3.1.2.1 direct attribute
scalar values or collections including Set (unordered, unique), List (ordered), or Array (ordered, sparse) as defined in [ISO 10303-11]

> NOTE Similar to the term "field" in common programming languages.

unit of information defining queries for obtaining related data and enforcing referential integrity

## 3.1.2.3 derived attribute
unit of information computed from other attributes using an expression defined in the schema

## 3.1.2.4 constraints on attributes
data type restricting the values of attributes

> NOTE The most general constraint is about the existence of attribute values. There are basically two types: mandatory and optional attributes. Values of mandatory attributes must be provided whereas values of optional attributes may be omitted.

> NOTE For aggregation data types such as Set, List, or Array, the existence constraint is often refined by a minimal and maximal number of elements, which is also known as cardinality.

## 3.1.3 classification
categorization, the act of distributing things into classes or categories of the same type

## 3.1.4 constraint
restriction for a specified reason

> NOTE A specialization of the general term control.

directive to meet specified requirements such as for scope, time, or cost

> NOTE A specialization of the general term object.

## 3.1.6 dictionary
collection of words, terms or concepts, with their definition

tangible physical product that can be described by its shape representation, material representations, and other properties

## 3.1.7.1 element occurrence
element's position within the project coordinate system and its containment within the spatial structure

## 3.1.8 entity
class of information defined by common attributes and constraints as defined in ISO 10303-11

> NOTE Similar to the term "class" in common programming languages but describing data structure only (not behavior such as methods).

## 3.1.9 external reference
link to information outside the data set, with direct relevance to the specific information the link originates from inside the data set

## 3.1.10 feature
parametric information and additional property information modifying the shape representation of an element to which it applies

## 3.1.11 group
collection of information that fulfills a specified purpose

> NOTE A specialization of the general term object.

## 3.1.12 identification
capability to find, retrieve, report, change, or delete specific instances without ambiguity

## 3.1.13 instance
occurrence of an entity

> NOTE Similar to the term "instance of a class" in object oriented programming.

## 3.1.14 library
catalogue, database or holder of data, that is relevant to information in the data set

> NOTE It is information referenced from an external source that is not copied into the data set.

## 3.1.15 model
a data set, governed by the structure of an underlying schema, to meet certain data requirements

> NOTE  Information models and building information models are examples for a model.

> NOTE  In scope of this standard IFC models are populations of the IFC schema.

## 3.1.16 model view
subset of a schema, representing the data structure required to fulfill the data requirements within one or several exchange scenarios

> NOTE  Beside being a subset of a schema, a model view (or model view definition) may also impose additional constraints to the population of the subset schema

## 3.1.16.1 concept
rules on using a subset of the schema structure identified as a concept template to enable a certain functionality within the context of a concept root contained in a model view

> NOTE  The utilization of material definitions for a particular concept root representing a wall is an example of a concept.

## 3.1.16.2 concept template
the specification of a subset of the schema structure to enable a certain unit of functionality

> NOTE  The identification of the entities, attributes and constraints needed to express a material definition independently on how it is utilized later in the context of a wall is an example of a concept template.

## 3.1.16.3 concept root
an entity of a schema used to assign concepts to describe the required functionality

> NOTE  A root concept often describes a model element, such as wall, air outlet, construction task, or similar, that is the root of a graph of connected entities and attributes defining the specific information items required, such as geometry, material, breakdown structure, etc.

## 3.1.17 object
anything perceivable or conceivable that has a distinct existence, albeit not material

## 3.1.17.1 object occurrence
characteristics of an object as an individual

> NOTE Similar to "object", "instance", "individual" in other publications.

## 3.1.17.2 object type
common characteristics shared by multiple object-occurrences

> NOTE Similar to "class", "template", "type" in other publications.

## 3.1.18 process
object-occurrence located in time, indicating "when"

## 3.1.19 product
physical or conceptual object that occurs in space

> NOTE It is specialization of the general term object.

## 3.1.20 project
encapsulation of related information for a particular purpose providing context for information contained within

> NOTE Context information may include default measurement units or representation context and precision.

## 3.1.21 property
unit of information that is dynamically defined as a particular entity instance

> NOTE Similar to "late-bound" or "run-time" in programming terminology.

## 3.1.21.1 property occurrence
unit of information providing a value for a property identified by name

## 3.1.21.2 property template
metadata for a property including name, description, and data type

> NOTE Similar in concept to "extension property" in common programming languages.

## 3.1.21.3 property set occurrence
unit of information containing a set of property occurrences, each having a unique name within the property set

## 3.1.21.4 property set template
set of property templates serving a common purpose and having applicability to objects of a particular entity

> NOTE Similar in concept to "extension class" in common programming languages.

## 3.1.22 proxy
object that does not hold a specific object type information

> NOTE a specialization of object occurrence.

## 3.1.23 quantity
measurement of a scope-based metric, specifically length, area, volume, weight, count, or time

## 3.1.24 relationship
unit of information describing an interaction between items

## 3.1.25 representation
unit of information describing how an object is displayed, such as physical shape or topology

## 3.1.26 resource
entity with limited availability such as materials, labor, or equipment

> NOTE a specialization of the general term object.

> NOTE the "resource definition data schemas" section is unrelated to this concept.

## 3.1.27 schema
the definition of the structure to organize data for storage, exchange and sharing, using a formal language

> NOTE  The formal languages EXPRESS ISO 10303-11 and XML Schema W3C Recommendation are currently used to define the schemata of this standard
