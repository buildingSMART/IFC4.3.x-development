IfcAirTerminalBoxType
=====================
The flow controller type **IfcAirTerminalBoxType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of air terminal boxes. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define an air terminal box type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcAirTerminalBoxType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcAirTerminalBoxType** are
represented by instances of _IfcAirTerminalBox_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcAirTerminalBox_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and
ports.
