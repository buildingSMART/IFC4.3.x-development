IfcAirToAirHeatRecovery
=======================
An air-to-air heat recovery device employs a counter-flow heat exchanger
between inbound and outbound air flow. It is typically used to transfer heat
from warmer air in one chamber to cooler air in the second chamber (i.e.,
typically used to recover heat from the conditioned air being exhausted and
the outside air being supplied to a building), resulting in energy savings
from reduced heating (or cooling) requirements.
