IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType
===========================
The energy conversion device type **IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType** defines
commonly shared information for occurrences of air to air heat recoverys. The
set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define an air to air heat recovery type specification indicating
the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that
product type. The **IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType** may be declared within
_IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be
exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
**IfcAirToAirHeatRecoveryType** are represented by instances of
