IfcAlignment2DSegment
=====================
An abstract entity defining common information about horizontal and vertical
alignment segments.  
  
> NOTE  The start and end tag are defined as annotations, not as referents
> along the alignment. Only absolute distance expressions are in scope, not
> distances ahead or behind a referent, such as a station. However such
> information can be exchanged as tags.
