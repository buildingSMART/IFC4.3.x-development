# IfcBearing


## Entity definition
Type of building element that is usually used to transmit loads from superstructure to substructure, and usually allowing movement (displacement or rotation) in one or more degrees of freedom. It is typically a mechanical component procured as a whole and installed on site, but in simple cases it may be built on site (composed of other building elements, element components, etc.).  

## Notes
NOTE  The sliding and roller materials are to be assigned to the bearing with the _Material Constituent Set_ concept.  
NOTE  The displacements and rotations accommodated can be defined in the _Pset_BearingCommon_ property set.
