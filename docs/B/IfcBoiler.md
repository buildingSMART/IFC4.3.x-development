IfcBoiler
=========
A boiler is a closed, pressure-rated vessel in which water or other fluid is
heated using an energy source such as natural gas, heating oil, or
electricity. The fluid in the vessel is then circulated out of the boiler for
use in various processes or heating applications.  
  
_IfcBoiler_ is a vessel solely used for heating of water or other fluids.
Storage vessels, such as for drinking water storage are considered as tanks
and use the _IfcTank_ entity.
