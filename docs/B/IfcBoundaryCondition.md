IfcBoundaryCondition
====================
The abstract entity _IfcBoundaryCondition_ is the supertype of all boundary
conditions that can be applied to structural connection definitions, either
directly for the connection (e.g. the joint) or for the relation between a
structural member and the connection.  
  
> NOTE  The boundary conditions are used within other parts, mainly by
> instances of _IfcStructuralConnection_ (for the definition of supports) and
> instances of _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ (for the definition of
> connections between structural members and structural connections).  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2.
