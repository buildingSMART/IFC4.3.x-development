IfcCableCarrierSegmentType
==========================
The flow segment type **IfcCableCarrierSegmentType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of cable carrier segments. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a cable carrier segment type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcCableCarrierSegmentType** may be declared within _IfcProject_
or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcCableCarrierSegmentType**
are represented by instances of _IfcCableCarrierSegment_. Refer to the
documentation at _IfcCableCarrierSegment_ for supported property sets,
materials, composition, and ports.
