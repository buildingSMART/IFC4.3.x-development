IfcColourRgb
============
{ .extDef}  
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-46:1992  
> A colour rgb as a subtype of colour specifications is defined by three
> colour component values for red, green, and blue in the RGB colour model.  
  
> NOTE  In contrary to the usual value range of colour components being
> integer from 0...255, the definition from ISO10303-46 defines the colour
> components as real from 0.0 ... 1.0. Applications need to execute this
> conversion before populating the colour RGB values.  
  
> NOTE  Corresponding STEP name: colour_rgb. The name attribute has been
> omitted, the data type for the reg, green and blue parts is
> _IfcNormalizedRatioMeasure_, that already includes the range restrictions
> for the values. Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-46:1994, p. 138 for the final
> definition of the formal standard.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2.
