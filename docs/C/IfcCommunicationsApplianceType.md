IfcCommunicationsApplianceType
==============================
The flow terminal type **IfcCommunicationsApplianceType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of communications appliances. The set of
shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a communications appliance type specification indicating
the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that
product type. The **IfcCommunicationsApplianceType** may be declared within
_IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be
exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
**IfcCommunicationsApplianceType** are represented by instances of
_IfcCommunicationsAppliance_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcCommunicationsAppliance_ for supported property sets, materials,
composition, and ports.
