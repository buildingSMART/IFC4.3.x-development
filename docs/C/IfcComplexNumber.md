IfcComplexNumber
================
_IfcComplexNumber_ is a representation of a complex number expressed as an
array with two elements. The first element (index 1) denotes the real
component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose square
roots can be calculated explicitly. The second element (index 2) denotes the
imaginary component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose
square roots cannot be determined other than through the provision of the
square of the imaginary number j where j\\\^2 = -1. Note that the imaginary
component may be referred to as i in certain references.
