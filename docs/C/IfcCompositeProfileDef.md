IfcCompositeProfileDef
======================
The _IfcCompositeProfileDef_ defines the profile by composition of other
profiles. The composition is given by a set of at least two other profile
definitions. Any profile definition (except for another composite profile) can
be used to construct the composite.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.  
  
Figure 314 illustrates the composite profile definition. The
_IfcCompositeProfileDef_ does not define an own position coordinate system, it
is directly defined in the underlying coordinate system. The underlying
coordinate system is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that
uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of either:  
  
* _IfcSweptSurface.Position_  
* _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_  
  
Or in case of sectioned spines it is the xy plane of each list member of
_IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions_. The _IfcCompositeProfileDef_ is
defined using other profile definitions. Those other profile definitions are
directly inserted into the underlying coordinate system.  
  
* In case of parameterized profile definitions, the _Position_ attribute of those standard profiles is used to place the profiles relatively to each other.  
* In case of arbitrary profile definitions, each Cartesian coordinate is given directly within the underlying coordinate system.

Twin profiles special case  
  
If twin profiles are modeled by profile composition, the base profile should
only be specified once. It is then included into the composite profile
directly and additionally indirectly via _IfcMirroredProfileDef_. For example,
a double angle made of two L100x10 with 10mm air gap between them, i.e. a _|
|_ shape, can be modeled as
