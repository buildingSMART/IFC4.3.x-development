IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry
============================
_IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry_ is used to describe the geometric constraints
that facilitate the physical connection of two objects at a surface or at a
face with surface geometry associated. It is envisioned as a control that
applies to the element connection relationships.  
  
The _IfcSurface_ (or the _IfcFaceSurface_ with an associated _IfcSurface_) at
the _SurfaceOnRelatingElement_ attribute defines the surface where the basic
geometry items of the connected elements connects. The surface geometry and
coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the
_RelatingElement_, as specified at the _IfcRelConnectsSubtype_ that utilizes
the _IfcConnectionSurfaceGeometry_. Optionally, the same surface geometry and
coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the
_RelatedElement_ by using the _SurfaceOnRelatedElement_ attribute.

| SurfaceOnRelatingElement | Surface at which related object is aligned at the relating element, given in the LCS of the relating element.                                                                                    |
| SurfaceOnRelatedElement  | Surface at which the relating element is aligned at the related element, given in the LCS of the related element. If the information is omitted, then the origin of the related element is used. |
