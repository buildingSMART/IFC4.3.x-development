IfcCooledBeamType
=================
The energy conversion device type **IfcCooledBeamType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of cooled beams. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a cooled beam type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The **IfcCooledBeamType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcCooledBeamType** are
represented by instances of _IfcCooledBeam_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcCooledBeam_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and
ports.
