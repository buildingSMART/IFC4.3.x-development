IfcCourse
=========
A building element whose length greatly exceeds its thickness and often also
its width, usually of a single material laid on site on top of another
horizontal or nearly horizontal building element. Structurally a Course does
not have capacity to carry loads over open span, or to be removed or replaced
as a single unit  
  
NOTE For IFC Road, the following types of courses have been identified but not
added to the conceptual model due to the fact that the elements (including
terms and definitions) can vary greatly between nations; instead, these would
be typical values of the inherited attribute ObjectType:  
  
\- **Paving** : Type of Course directly in contact with traffic loads e.g. in
gravel road (also Surface layer or Wearing course).  
\- **AnticapillaryLayer** : Type of Course, layer preventing capillary rise of
water from underlying layers.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Protective bottom layer with no fines, designed to
prevent capillary rise of water from the subgrade soil or from underlying
layers.  
\- **AntifreezingLayer** : Type of Course, layer intended to prevent frost
from penetrating into the subgrade. Also: Frost blanket course.  
\- **BaseCourse** : A layer immediately beneath the surface of binder course
providing additional load distribution and contributing to the sub-surface
drainage.  
\- **BinderCourse** : A layer to distribute loads to the base course.  
\- **CappingLayer** : Top layer of subgrade to improve its load bearing
capacity.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Optional layer of granular or treated material on
top of the subgrade and immediately below formation level, to provide improved
foundation for the subbase layer [CEN].  
\- **DrainingCourse** : Layer of pervious material to relieve pore pressure or
facilitate drainage of overlying layers.  
\- **TackCoat** : A thin coating of tar or asphalt applied before a road is
laid to form an adhesive bond.  
\- **LayingCourse** : Type of Course, layer of material providing a bed for
which block (stone) paving.  
\- **RegulatingCourse** : Type of Course, layer of variable thickness for
adjusting a surface so meet specified even level. Also: Levelling course.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Course of variable thickness applied to an
existing course or surface to provide the necessary profile for a further
course of constant thickness (CEN).  
\- **Sealing** : A layer of impermeable material.  
\- **SubBaseCourse** : A layer between subgrade and base course.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Layer or layers of specified or selected material
of designed thickness placed on a subgrade to support a base layer (or a
cement concrete slab in the case of rigid pavements).  
\- **SeparationLayer** : A layer intended to prevent mixing of material from
above layer with fine material or water in layer below.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Layer of material designed to prevent the ascent
of water or fines from a lower layer.  
\- **AnticrackingLayer** : A layer intended to isolate surface layers from
cracking in lower layer.  
NOTE Definition from PIARC Layer intended to prevent the reflection of cracks
from a lower layer to the surface.  
\- **PrimeCoat** : An application of a low viscosity asphalt to a granular
base in preparation for an initial layer of asphalt.  
\- **VergeFill** : Soft shoulder between paved surface and side slope.
