IfcCurveBoundedSurface
======================
The _IfcCurveBoundedSurface_ is a parametric surface with boundaries defined
by p-curves, that is, a curve which lies on the basis of a surface and is
defined in the parameter space of that surface. The p-curve is a special type
of a composite curve segment and shall only be used to bound a surface.  
  
The outer boundary shall be either defined by:  
  
* an _IfcOuterBoundaryCurve_ a closed composite curve on surface for the definition of an outer boundary, in this case the attribute _ImplicitOuter_ has to be set to FALSE, or  
* an implicit boundary of the bounded surface, e.g. the u1, u2, v1, v2 of _IfcRectangularTrimmedSurface_, in this case the attribute _ImplicitOuter_ has to be set to TRUE.

Informal Propositions:  
  
1\. Each curve in the set of _Boundaries_ shall be closed.  
2\. No two curves in the set of _Boundaries_ shall intersect.  
3\. At most one of the boundary curves may enclose any other boundary curve.
If an _IfcOuterBoundaryCurve_ is designated, only that curve may enclose any
other boundary curve.
