IfcDistributionChamberElementType
=================================
The distribution flow element type **IfcDistributionChamberElementType**
defines commonly shared information for occurrences of distribution chamber
elements. The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a distribution chamber element type specification
indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences
of that product type. The **IfcDistributionChamberElementType** may be
declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and
may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
**IfcDistributionChamberElementType** are represented by instances of
_IfcDistributionChamberElement_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcDistributionChamberElement_ for supported property sets, materials,
composition, and ports.
