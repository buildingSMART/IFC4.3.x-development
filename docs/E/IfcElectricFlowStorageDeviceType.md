IfcElectricFlowStorageDeviceType
================================
The flow storage device type **IfcElectricFlowStorageDeviceType** defines
commonly shared information for occurrences of electric flow storage devices.
The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a electric flow storage device type specification
indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences
of that product type. The **IfcElectricFlowStorageDeviceType** may be declared
within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be
exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of
**IfcElectricFlowStorageDeviceType** are represented by instances of
_IfcElectricFlowStorageDevice_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcElectricFlowStorageDevice_ for supported property sets, materials,
composition, and ports.
