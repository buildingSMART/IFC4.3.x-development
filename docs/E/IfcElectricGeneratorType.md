IfcElectricGeneratorType
========================
The energy conversion device type **IfcElectricGeneratorType** defines
commonly shared information for occurrences of electric generators. The set of
shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a electric generator type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcElectricGeneratorType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcElectricGeneratorType**
are represented by instances of _IfcElectricGenerator_. Refer to the
documentation at _IfcElectricGenerator_ for supported property sets,
materials, composition, and ports.
