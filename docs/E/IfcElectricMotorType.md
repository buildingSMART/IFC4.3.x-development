IfcElectricMotorType
====================
The energy conversion device type **IfcElectricMotorType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of electric motors. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a electric motor type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcElectricMotorType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcElectricMotorType** are
represented by instances of _IfcElectricMotor_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcElectricMotor_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and
ports.
