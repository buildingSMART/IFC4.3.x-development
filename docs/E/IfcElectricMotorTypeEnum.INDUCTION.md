IfcElectricMotorTypeEnum.INDUCTION
==================================
An alternating current motor in which the primary winding on one member
(usually the stator) is connected to the power source and a secondary winding
or a squirrel-cage secondary winding on the other member (usually the rotor)
carries the induced current. There is no physical electrical connection to the
secondary winding, its current is induced.
