IfcEvaporativeCoolerTypeEnum.INDIRECTEVAPORATIVEWETCOIL
=======================================================
Indirect evaporative wet coil: Cools the air stream by evaporating water
indirectly and without adding moisture into the air stream. Water is sprayed
directly on the tubes of the heat exchanger where latent cooling takes place
and the vaporization of the water on the outside of the heat exchanger tubes
allows the simultaneous heat and mass transfer which removes heat from the
supply air on the tube side.
