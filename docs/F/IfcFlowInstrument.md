IfcFlowInstrument
=================
A flow instrument reads and displays the value of a particular property of a
system at a point, or displays the difference in the value of a property
between two points.  
  
Instrumentation is typically for the purpose of determining the value of the
property at a point in time. It is not the purpose of an instrument to record
or integrate the values over time (although they may be connected to recording
devices that do perform such a function). This entity provides for all forms
of mechanical flow instrument (thermometers, pressure gauges etc.) and
electrical flow instruments (ammeters, voltmeters etc.)
