IfcGeotechnicalStratum
======================
Representation of the concept of an identified discrete almost homogenous
geological feature with either an irregular solid or 'Yabuki' top surface
shape or a regular voxel cubic shape. A stratum is represented as a discrete
entity, specialised (sub typed) from
[_IfcElement_]($element://{B8038DA1-0F9B-4585-AF55-52C23EBB33CD}). A stratum
may be broken down into smaller entities if properties vary across the stratum
or alternatively properties may be described with bounded numeric ranges. A
stratum may carry information about the physical form and its interpretation
as a Geological Item (GML).  
The shape representations used should correspond to the sub-type of
[_IfcGeotechnicalAssembly_]($element://{85B77FDE-67EA-40a4-ADA4-ADD4C95A7D3E})
in which it occurs
