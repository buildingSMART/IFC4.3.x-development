IfcIShapeProfileDef
===================
_IfcIShapeProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining
parameters of an ''I'' or ''H'' section. The I-shape profile has values for
its overall depth, width and its web and flange thicknesses. Additionally a
fillet radius, flange edge radius, and flange slope may be given. This profile
definition represents an I-section which is symmetrical about its major and
minor axes; top and bottom flanges are equal and centred on the web.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.  
  
{ .change-ifc2x4}  
> IFC4 CHANGE  Type of _FilletRadius_ relaxed to allow for zero radius.
> Attributes _FlangeEdgeRadius_ and _FlangeSlope_ added.  
  
Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the I-shape profile definition.

_Position_  
  
  
The parameterized  
profile defines its own position coordinate system.  
The underlying  
coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid  
that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

  

  

  * IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position
  

  
by using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile  
can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position  
relative to the profile. Explicit coordinate offsets are used to define  
cardinal points (e.g. upper-left bound).  

_Parameter_  
  
  
The parameterized profile  
is defined by a set of parameter attributes, see attribute definition  
below.

Note:  
The black coordinate axes show the  
underlying coordinate system of the swept surface or swept area solid  
|  

_Position_  
  
  
The profile is inserted into the underlying  
coordinate system of the swept area solid by using the _Position_  
attribute. In this example (cardinal point of lower left corner) the  
attribute values of _IfcAxis2Placement2D_  
are:

> `Location  
> = IfcCartesianPoint(<1/2  
> OverallWidth>,<1/2 OverallDepth>)  
>  
> RefDirection = NIL (defaults to 1.,0.)`
>
>  
>

  

_Parameter_  
  
If the _FilletRadius_  
is given, it is equally applied to all four corners created by the web  
and flanges.

| OverallWidth     | Total extent of the width, defined parallel to the x axis of the position coordinate system.                                                                                    |

| WebThickness     | Thickness of the web of the I-shape. The web is centred on the x-axis and the y-axis of the position coordinate system.                                                         |
| FlangeThickness  | Flange thickness of the I-shape. Both, the upper and the lower flanges have the same thickness and they are centred on the y-axis of the position coordinate system.            |
| FilletRadius     | The fillet between the web and the flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.                                                                                                |
| FlangeEdgeRadius | Radius of the lower edges of the top flange and the upper edges of the bottom flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.                                                     |
| FlangeSlope      | Slope of the lower faces of the top flange and of the upper faces of the bottom flange. Non-zero in case of tapered flanges, 0 in case of parallel flanges, omitted if unknown. |
