======================
In an irregular time series, unpredictable bursts of data arrive at
unspecified points in time, or most time stamps cannot be characterized by a
repeating pattern.  
  
> EXAMPLE  A circulating pump cycles on and off at unpredictable times as
> dictated by the demands on the piping system; the amount of light in a
> classroom varies depending on when the lights are manually switched on and
> off and how many lamps are controlled by each switch.
