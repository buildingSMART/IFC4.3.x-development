===========
Representation of the concept of a linear geological and geotechnical model,
usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating
measurement

and lining. The contained subtypes of
[_IfcGeotechnicalStratum_]($element://{FAEFB134-3800-4995-B222-B921D7E287BF})
will have shape representations made from straight or bent tubes reflecting
the bore diameter, or discs if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.
