IfcChangeActionEnum
===================
_IfcChangeActionEnum_ identifies the type of change that might have occurred
to the object during the last session (for example, added, modified, deleted).
This information is required in a partial model exchange scenario so that an
application or model server will know how an object might have been affected
by the previous application. Valid enumerations are:  
  
Consider Application A will create an IFC dataset that it wants to publish to
others for modification and have the ability to subsequently merge these
changes back into the original model. Before publication, it may want to set
the _IfcChangeActionEnum_ to NOCHANGE to establish a baseline so that other
application changes can be easily identified. Application B then receives this
IFC dataset and adds a new object and sets _IfcChangeActionEnum_ to ADDED with
Application B defined as the OwningApplication. Application B then modifies an
existing object and (re)defines the LastModifiedDate to the time of the
modification, LastModifyingUser to the _IfcPersonAndOrganization_ making the
change, and sets the LastModifyingApplication to Application B. When
Application A receives this modified dataset, it can determine which objects
have been added and modified by Application B and either merge or reject these
changes as necessary. Consequently, the intent is that an application only
modifies the value of _IfcChangeActionEnum_ when it does something to the
object, with the further intent that a model server is responsible for
clearing the _IfcChangeActionEnum_ back to NOCHANGE when it is ready to be
republished.
