IfcColourRgbList
================
The _IfcColourRgbList_ defines an ordered collection of RGB colour values.
Each colour value is a fixed list of three colour components (red, green,
blue). The attribute _ColourList_ is a two-dimensional list, where:  
  
* first dimension is an unbounded list representing each colour value;  
* second dimension is a fixed list of four list members, where [1] is the red component, [2] the green component, and [3] the blue component.  
  
> NOTE  The _IfcColourRgbList_ is introduced to provide a compact
> representation of an indexable representation of colours for tessellated
> items.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC4.
