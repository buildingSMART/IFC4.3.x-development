> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A conic is a planar curve which could be produced by intersecting a plane
> with a cone. A conic is defined in terms of its intrinsic geometric
> properties rather than being described in terms of other geometry. A conic
> entity always has a placement coordinate system defined by axis2_placement;
> the parametric representation is defined in terms of this placement
> coordinate system.  
  
> NOTE Entity adapted from **conic** defined in ISO 10303-42
