IfcConstructionMaterialResourceType
===================================
The resource type _IfcConstructionMaterialType_ defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of construction material resources. The set of
shared information may include:  
  
* common productivities  
* common cost rates  
* common properties within shared property sets  
  
It is used to define a construction material resource specification (the
specific resource information that is common to all occurrences of that
resource). Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to
occurrences.  
  
Occurrences of the _IfcConstructionMaterialResourceType_ are represented by
instances of _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_.

Assignment Use Definition  
  
In addition to assignments specified at the base class
_IfcConstructionResourceType_, a construction material resource type may have
assignments of its own using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ where
_RelatingResource_ refers to the _IfcConstructionMaterialResourceType_ and
_RelatedObjects_ contains one or more _IfcTypeProduct_ subtypes. Such
relationship indicates material specifications to be used as input, which is
instantiated as an occurrence assigned for each resource occurrence. The
_IfcGeographicElementType_ product type may be used to hold the material
representation (via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_. There may be multiple chains
of production where such product type may have its own task and resource types
assigned indicating how to transport or extract such material.
