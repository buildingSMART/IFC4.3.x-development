IfcCooledBeam
=============
A cooled beam (or chilled beam) is a device typically used to cool air by
circulating a fluid such as chilled water through exposed finned tubes above a
space. Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam
uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the
naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops
back to the floor where the cycle begins again.
