IfcDistributionBoard
====================
A distribution board is a flow controller in which instances of electrical or
communication devices are brought together at a single place for a particular
purpose.  
  
A distribution provides a housing for connected distribution elements so that
they can be viewed, operated or acted upon from a single place. Each connected
item may have its own geometric representation and location.
