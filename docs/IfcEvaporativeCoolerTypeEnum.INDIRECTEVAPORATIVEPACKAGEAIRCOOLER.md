IfcEvaporativeCoolerTypeEnum.INDIRECTEVAPORATIVEPACKAGEAIRCOOLER
================================================================
Indirect evaporative package air cooler: Cools the air stream by evaporating
water indirectly and without adding moisture into the air stream. On one side
of the heat exchanger, the secondary air stream is cooled by evaporation,
while on the other side of heat exchanger, the primary air stream (conditioned
air to be supplied to the room) is sensibly cooled by the heat exchanger
surfaces.
