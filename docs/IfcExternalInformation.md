IfcExternalInformation
======================
An _IfcExternalInformation_ is the identification of an information source
that is not explicitly represented in the current model or in the project
database (as an implementation of the current model). The
_IfcExternalInformation_ identifies the external source (classification,
document, or library), but not the particular items such as a dictionary
entry, a classification notation, or a document reference within the external
source  
  
The _IfcExternalInformation_ is an abstract supertype of all external
information entities.
