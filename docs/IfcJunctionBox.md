IfcJunctionBox
==============
A junction box is an enclosure within which cables are connected.  
  
Cables may be members of an electrical circuit (for electrical power systems)
or be information carriers (in a telecommunications system). A junction box is
typically intended to conceal a cable junction from sight, eliminate tampering
or provide a safe place for electrical connection.
