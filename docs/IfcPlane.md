IfcPlane
========
The planar surface is an unbounded surface in the direction of _x_ and _y_.
Bounded planar surfaces are defined by using a subtype of _IfcBoundedSurface_
with _BasisSurface_ being a plane.

> A plane is an unbounded surface with a constant normal. A plane is defined
> by a point on the plane and the normal direction to the plane. The data is
> to be interpreted as follows:
    
    
      
       C = Position.Location  
       x = Position.P[1]  
       y = Position.P[2]  
       z = Position.P[3] => normal to plane  
    

and the surface is parameterized as:  
{ .extDef}

> where the parametric range is -∞ < _u,v_ < ∞. In the above parameterization
> the length unit for the unit vectors **x** and **y** is derived from the
> context of the plane.

> = left bound in **x**, _U2_ = right bound in **x**, _V_1 = lower bound in
> **y**, _V2_ = upper bound in **y** if viewed into the direction of the
> negative normal. (assuming the _Usense_ and _Vsense_ agree to the sense of

The inherited attributes are interpreted as  
  
* _SELF\\\IfcElementarySurface.Position_ defines the location and orientation of the planar surface.  
* _SELF\\\IfcElementarySurface.Position.Location_ defines a point on the planar surface.  
* _SELF\\\IfcElementarySurface.Position.P[3]_ defines the normal of the planar surface.
