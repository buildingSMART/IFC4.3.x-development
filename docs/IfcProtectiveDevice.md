IfcProtectiveDevice
===================
A protective device breaks an electrical circuit when a stated electric
current that passes through it is exceeded.  
  
A protective device provides protection against electrical current only (not
as a general protective device). It may be used to represent the complete set
of elements including both the tripping unit and the breaking unit that
provide the protection. This may be particularly useful at earlier stages of
design where the approach to breaking the electrical supply may be determined
but the method of tripping may not. Alternatively, this entity may be used to
specifically represent the breaking unit alone (in which case the tripping
unit will also be specifically identified). This entity is specific to
dedicated protective devices and excludes electrical outlets that may have
circuit protection.
