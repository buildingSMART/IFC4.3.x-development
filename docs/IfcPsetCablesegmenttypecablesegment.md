===================================
Electrical cable with a specific purpose to lead electric current within a
circuit or any other electric construction. Includes all types of electric
cables, mainly several electrical segments wrapped together, e.g. cable, tube,
busbar. Note that the number of conductors within a cable is determined by an
aggregation mechanism that aggregates the conductors within the cable. A
single-core cable is defined in IEV 461-06-02 as being ''a cable having only
one core''; a multiconductor cable is defined in IEV 461-06-03 as b eing ''a
cable having more than one conductor, some of which may be uninsulated''; a
mulicore cable is defined in IEV 461-06-04 as being ''a cable having more than
one core''.
