IfcRailType
===========
The element type _IfcRailType_ defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of rails. The set of shared information may include:  

  

  * common properties within shared property sets
  

  * common material information
  

  * common profile definitions
  

  * common shape representations
  

  
It is used to define a rail specification, or rail style (the specific product
information that is common to all occurrences of that rail type). Rail types
may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.  
Occurrences of the _IfcRailType_ are represented by instances of _IfcRail_.
