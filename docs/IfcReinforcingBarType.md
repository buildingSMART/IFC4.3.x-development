IfcReinforcingBarType
=====================
The reinforcing element type **IfcReinforcingBarType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of reinforcing bars. The set of shared information
may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
  
It is used to define a reinforcing bar type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcReinforcingBarType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcReinforcingBarType** are
represented by instances of _IfcReinforcingBar_.
