IfcRepresentationItem
=====================
The _IfcRepresentationItem_ is used within an _IfcRepresentation_ (directly or
indirectly through other _IfcRepresentationItem_''s) to represent an
_IfcProductRepresentation_. Most commonly these _IfcRepresentationItem_''s are
geometric or topological representation items, that can (but not need to) have
presentation style infomation assigned.  
  
{ .extDef}  
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-43:1992  
> A representation item is an element of product data that participates in one
> or more representations or contributes to the definition of another
> representation item. A representation item contributes to the definition of
> another representation item when it is referenced by that representation
> item.  
  
> NOTE  The assignment of a style is only applicable to the subtypes
> _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_, _IfcMappedItem_ and some selected subtypes
> of _IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem_ (_IfcVertexPoint_, _IfcEdgeCurve_,
> _IfcFaceSurface_).  
  
In case that presentation style information is applied, it can be either
applied by an _IfcStyledItem_, or by an assignment to an
_IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_. If both are present, and both style
assignments include the same subtype of _IfcPresentationStyle_, then the style
assigned by _IfcStyledItem_ takes priority.  
  
Figure 1 shows an instance diagram explaining the use of _IfcStyledItem_ and
_IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_ to apply presentation styles.  
  
> EXAMPLE  The assignment of style information by a styled item and a
> presentation layer with style. Since the presentation styles are different,
> _IfcCurveStyle_ and _IfcSurfaceStyle_, both are applied to the geometric
> representation item.

Figure 2 shows in instance diagram explaining the override of
_IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_ by _IfcStyledItem_ to apply presentation
styles.  
  
> EXAMPLE  The assignment of style information by a styled item and a
> presentation layer with style. Since the presentation styles for curve style
> are aprovided by both, the _IfcCurveStyle_ provided by the _IfcStyledItem_
> overrides the _IfcCurveStyle_ provided by the
> _IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle_
