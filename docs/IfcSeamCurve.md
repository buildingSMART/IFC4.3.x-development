IfcSeamCurve
============
An _IfcSeamCurve_ is a 3-dimensional curve that has additional representations
provided by exactly two distinct pcurves describing the same curve at the two
extreme ends of a closed parametric surface.  
  
> NOTE&bbsp; The `seam'' on a cylinder has representations as the lines u = 0
> or u = 360 degrees in parameter space.  
  
Figure 1 shows an instance diagram explaining the use of _IfcSeamCurve_ as a
boundary curve of an _IfcCylindricalSurface_.
