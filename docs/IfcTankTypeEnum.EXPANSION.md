IfcTankTypeEnum.EXPANSION
=========================
A closed container used in a closed fluid distribution system to mitigate the
effects of thermal expansion or water hammer. The tank is typically
constructed with a diaphragm dividing the tank into two sections, with fluid
on one side of the diaphragm and air on the other. One example application is
when connected to the primary circuit of a hot water system to accommodate the
increase in volume of the water when it is heated.
