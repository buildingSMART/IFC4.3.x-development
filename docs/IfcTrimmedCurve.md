IfcTrimmedCurve
===============
An _IfcTrimmedCurve_ is a bounded curve that is trimmed at both ends. The
trimming points may be provided by a Cartesian point or by a parameter value,
based on the parameterization of the _BasisCurve_. The _SenseAgreement_
attribute indicates whether the direction of the _IfcTrimmedCurve_ agrees with
or is opposed to the direction of the _BasisCurve_.  
  
> NOTE  In case of the _BasisCurve_ being a closed curve, such as an
> _IfcCircle_ or _IfcEllipse_, the _SenseAgreement_ affects the geometric
> shape of the _IfcTrimmedCurve_.

Figure 1 shows the four arcs (dashed blue and green lines with arrow showing
different orientations) that can be defined by the same _BasisCurve_ (of type
_IfcCircle_) and the same trimming points (given by Cartesian points and
parameter values) by using different assignments to _Trim1_ and _Trim2_ and
_SenseAgreement_.

At least one of these shall be specified at each end of the curve. The
_SenseAgreement_ makes it possible to unambiguously define any segment of a
closed curve such as a circle. The combinations of sense and ordered end
points make it possible to define four distinct directed segments connecting
two different points on a circle or other closed curve. For this purpose
cyclic properties of the parameter range are assumed; for example, 370 degrees
is equivalent to 10 degrees.

> The _IfcTrimmedCurve_ has a parameterization which is inherited from the

> trimmed curve is derived from the parameter of the basis curve as follows:

> * if _SenseAgreement_ is TRUE: _s = t - t\X\7E1\X\7E_  
> * if _SenseAgreement_ is FALSE: _s = t\X\7E2\X\7E - t_  
  
In the above equations t\X\7E1\X\7E is the value given by _Trim1_ or the
parameter value corresponding to point 1 and t\X\7E2\X\7E is the value given
by _Trim2_ or the parameter value corresponding to point 2. The resultant
_IfcTrimmedCurve_ has a parameter ranging from 0 at the first trimming point
to |t\X\7E2\X\7E - t\X\7E1\X\7E| at the second trimming point.

by the parametric length for consistency with the sense flag.

Informal Propositions:  
  
1\. Where both the parameter value and the Cartesian point exist for _Trim1_
and _Trim2_ they shall be consistent. (i.e., the _BasisCurve_ evaluated at the
parameter value shall coincide with the specified point).  
2\. When a Cartesian point is specified by _Trim1_ or by _Trim2_ it shall lie
on the _BasisCurve_.  
3\. Except the case of a closed _BasisCurve_ where both parameter 1 and
parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the sense flag, i.e., (sense
= parameter 1 < parameter 2). Or, for every open curve where both parameter 1
and parameter 2 exist, they shall be consistent with the _SenseAgreement_,
i.e., _SenseAgreement_ = (parameter 1 < parameter 2).  
4\. If both parameter 1 and parameter 2 exist, then parameter 1 <> parameter
2. For a closed base curve, e.g. _IfcCircle_ or _IfcEllipse_, this also
applies to the cyclic properties, as 360'' is equal to 0'', parameter 1 =
360'' and parameter 2 = 0'' are treated as being equal and therefore violating
this proposition.  
5\. When a parameter value is specified by _Trim1_ or _Trim2_ it shall lie
within the parametric range of the _BasisCurve_.
