IfcTypeProcess
==============
_IfcTypeProcess_ defines a specific (or type) definition of a process or
activity without being assigned to a schedule or a time.\S\ It is used to
define a process or activity specification, that is, the specific process or
activity information that is common to all occurrences that are defined for
that process or activity type.  
  
An _IfcTypeProcess_ may have a list of property set attached. Values of these
properties are common to all occurrences of that process or activity type. The
type occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship
_IfcRelDefinesByType_.  
  
Subtypes of _IfcTypeProcess_ may be exchanged without being already assigned
to subtypes of _IfcProcess_.
