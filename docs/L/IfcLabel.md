IfcLabel
========
A label is the term by which something may be referred to. It is a string
which represents the human-interpretable name of something and shall have a
natural-language meaning.

Value restrictions  
  
As a human-readable string for naming purposes, a label is usually human-
specified and locale-dependent (in contrast to purely machine-readable
identifiers, _IfcIdentifier_).  
  
> NOTE  The set of characters that may appear in STRINGs exchanged in the
> exchange structure as defined in ISO 10303.21 is provided in ISO 10646. The
> encoding of characters in case of file-based exchange is defined in ISO
> 10303-21 and ISO 10303-28. Among else, these specifications define the
> encoding of 8-bit characters from ISO 8859-1...-16 and of 2-byte and 4-byte
> Unicode characters from ISO 10646.  
  
> NOTE  While _IfcIdentifier_ is restricted to 255 characters, the size in
> exchange files after encoding may be considerably larger than 255 octets,
> depending on the particular encoding and on the contents of the identifier.
