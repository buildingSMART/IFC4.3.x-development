IfcLampType
===========
The flow terminal type **IfcLampType** defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of lamps. The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a lamp type specification indicating the specific product
information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The
**IfcLampType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_
using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the
type. Occurrences of **IfcLampType** are represented by instances of
_IfcLamp_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcLamp_ for supported property
sets, materials, composition, and ports.
