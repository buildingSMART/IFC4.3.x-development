IfcLightFixtureType
===================
The flow terminal type **IfcLightFixtureType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of light fixtures. The set of shared information
may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a light fixture type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcLightFixtureType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcLightFixtureType** are
represented by instances of _IfcLightFixture_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcLightFixture_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and
ports.
