{ .extDef}  
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997:  
> The directional light node defines a directional light source that
> illuminates along rays parallel to a given 3-dimensional vector. Directional
> light nodes do not attenuate with distance. Directional light nodes are
> specified in the local coordinate system and are affected by ancestor
> transformations.  
  
> NOTE  Corresponding ISO 10303 entity: light_source_directional. Please refer
> to ISO/IS 10303-46:1994, p. 32 for the final definition of the formal
> standard.  
  
> NOTE  In addition to the attributes as defined in ISO 10303-46 the
> additional property from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997 (VRML) _AmbientIntensity_ and
> _Intensity_ are inherited from the supertype.
