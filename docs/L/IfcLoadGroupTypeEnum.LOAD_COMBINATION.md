IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum.LOAD_COMBINATION
=====================================
An intermediate level between LOAD_CASE and LOAD_COMBINATION. This level is
obsolete and deprecated. Before the introduction of
_IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_, the purpose of this level was to provide a
factor with which one or more LOAD_CASEs occur in a LOAD_COMBINATION.
