IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering
==================================
_IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering_ specifies dual material profile sets in
association with tapered prismatic (beam- or column-like) elements.

Usage with tapered building elements  
  
The inherited attribute _ForProfileSet_ specifies the profile and material at
the start of the member, _ForProfileEndSet_ at its end. Start and end
correspond to the extrusion direction in the shape model of the shape
representation of the element or element type.  
  
Both material profile sets should refer to the same material, that is, only
differ with respect to their profiles.  
  
{ .use-head}  
Usage with structural analysis curve members  
  
_IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering_ may be used with the structural analysis
idealization (_IfcStructuralCurveMember_) of uniform members as well as of
tapered members.  
  
In case of uniform members, _ForProfileSet_ and _ForProfileEndSet_ refer to
the same material profile set. In case of tapered members, _ForProfileSet_
specifies the profile and material at the start of the member,
_ForProfileEndSet_ at its end. Start and end correspond to the edge direction
in the topological representation of the curve member.

| CardinalEndPoint | Index reference to a significant point in the second section profile. Describes how this section is aligned relative to the axis of the member it is associated with. This parametric specification of profile alignment can be provided redundantly to the explicit alignment defined by ForProfileSet.MaterialProfiles[\\\\*].Profile. |
