IfcModulusOfRotationalSubgradeReactionMeasure
=============================================
_IfcModulusOfRotationalSubgradeReactionMeasure_ is a measure for modulus of
rotational subgrade reaction, which expresses the rotational elastic bedding
of a linear structural element per length, such as for a beam. It is typically
measured in Nm/(m\\\\*rad).
