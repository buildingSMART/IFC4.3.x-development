IfcOutletType
=============
The flow terminal type **IfcOutletType** defines commonly shared information
for occurrences of outlets. The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a outlet type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The **IfcOutletType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcOutletType** are
represented by instances of _IfcOutlet_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcOutlet_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
