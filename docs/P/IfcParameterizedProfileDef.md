IfcParameterizedProfileDef
==========================
The parameterized profile definition defines a 2D position coordinate system
to which the parameters of the different profiles relate to. All profiles are
defined centric to the origin of the position coordinate system, or more
specific, the origin [0.,0.] shall be in the center of the bounding box of the
profile.  
  
The _Position_ attribute of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is used to position
the profile within the XY plane of the underlying coordinate system of the
swept surface geometry, the swept area solid or the sectioned spine. It can be
used to position the profile at any point which becomes the origin [0.,0.,0.]
of the extruded or rotated surface or solid.  
  
The _Position_ attribute should not be used if the transformation can be
specified in a containing object instead. In particular, this applies if the
_IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is referenced as _SweptArea_ in subtypes of
_IfcSweptAreaSolid_ or as _CrossSections_ in _IfcSectionedSpine_.  
  
Several subtypes of _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ provide shape parameters
which are optional. Sending systems should always provide values for these
parameters if possible. If these parameters are left unspecified, receiving
systems may retrieve values for them by external reference (if a reference to
an external document or library is given; see guidance at _IfcProfileDef_), or
estimate them, or simply assume zero values.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x2.  
  
{ .change-ifc2x}  
> IFC2x CHANGE  The _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_ is introduced as an
> intermediate new abstract entity that unifies the definition and usage of
> the position coordinate system for all parameterized profiles. The Position
> attribute has been removed at all subtypes (like _IfcRectangleProfileDef_,
> _IfcCircleProfileDef_, etc.).  
  
{ .change-ifc2x3}  
> IFC2x3 CHANGE  All profile origins are now in the center of the bounding
> box.  
  
{ .change-ifc2x4}  
> IFC4 CHANGE  _Position_ attribute made optional (default: identity
> transformation).  
> Several radius parameters in subtypes have been changed from optional
> _IfcPositiveLengthMeasure_ (assumed default: 0.) to optional
> _IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure_ (default: unspecified). This change allows to
> explicitly specify zero radius. Sending systems shall export 0. values if
> parameters are known to be 0.  
> Subtypes _IfcCraneRailAShapeProfileDef_ and _IfcCraneRailFShapeProfileDef_
> deleted. Rail profiles shall be modeled as _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ or
> as _IfcAsymmetricIShapeProfileDef_ together with appropriate external
> reference.
