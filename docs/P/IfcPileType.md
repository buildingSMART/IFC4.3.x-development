IfcPileType
===========
The building element type **IfcPileType** defines commonly shared information
for occurrences of piles. The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
  
It is used to define a pile type specification indicating the specific product
information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The
**IfcPileType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_
using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the
type. Occurrences of **IfcPileType** are represented by instances of
_IfcPile_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcPile_ for supported property
sets, materials, and composition.
