IfcPlacement
============
An _IfcPlacement_ is an abstract supertype of placement subtypes that define
the location of an item, or an entire shape representation, and provide its
orientation. All placement subtypes define right-handed Cartesian coordinate
systems and do not allow mirroring.  
  
> NOTE  Cartesian transformations including mirroring and scaling are
> supported by _IfcCartesianTransformationOperator_

> A placement locates a geometric item with respect to the coordinate system
> of its geometric context. It locates the item to be defined and, in the case
> of the axis placement subtypes, gives its orientation.  
  
> NOTE  Entity adapted from **placement** defined in ISO 10303-42.
