IfcPlaneAngleMeasure
====================
An _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_ is the value of an angle in a plane.  
  
Usually measured in radian (rad, m/m = 1), but also grads may be used. The
grad unit has to be declared as a conversion based unit based on radian unit.  
  
> NOTE  _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_ is used where angles need to be described to an
> accuracy of less than one degree and expressed as decimal parts of an angle.
> It is widely used for angular measurement except for situations where
> accuracy needs to be defined using arc measurement; for which purpose the
> _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ is provided.  
  
Type: REAL  
  
> NOTE  Type adapted from **plane_angle_measure** defined in ISO 10303-41.  
  
> HISTORY  New type in IFC1.5.1.
