IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum
===========================
The _IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum_ specifically defines the range of different
breaker unit types that can be used in conjunction with protective device.
Types may also be used as a reference to a complete protective device in
circumstances where tripping units are not separately identified (typically
expected to be the case during earlier stages of design).

| EARTHINGSWITCH                | A safety device used to open or close a circuit when there is no current. Used to isolate a part of a circuit, a machine, a part of an overhead line or an underground line so that maintenance can be safely conducted.                                                                                      |
| EARTHLEAKAGECIRCUITBREAKER    | A device that opens, closes, or isolates a circuit and has short circuit protection but no overload protection. It attempts to break the circuit when there is a leakage of current from phase to earth, by measuring voltage on the earth conductor.                                                         |
| VARISTOR                      | A high voltage surge protection device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| VOLTAGELIMITER                | a voltage limiter is an equipment that prevents the over voltage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| RESIDUALCURRENTSWITCH         | A device that opens, closes or isolates a circuit and has no short circuit or overload protection. May also be identified as a ''ground fault switch''.                                                                                                                                                       |
| RESIDUALCURRENTCIRCUITBREAKER | A device that opens, closes, or isolates a circuit and has short circuit and overload protection. It attempts to break the circuit when there is a difference in current between any two phases. May also be referred to as ''Ground Fault Interupter (GFI)'' or ''Ground Fault Circuit Interuptor (GFCI)''', |
