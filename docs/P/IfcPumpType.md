IfcPumpType
===========
The flow moving device type **IfcPumpType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of pumps. The set of shared information may
include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a pump type specification indicating the specific product
information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The
**IfcPumpType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_
using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the
type. Occurrences of **IfcPumpType** are represented by instances of
_IfcPump_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcPump_ for supported property
sets, materials, composition, and ports.
