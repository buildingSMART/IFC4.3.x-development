IfcRailingType
==============
The building element type 'IfcRailingType' defines commonly shared information
for occurrences of railings. The set of shared information may include:  

  

  * common properties with shared property sets
  

  * common representations
  

  * common materials
  

  * common composition of elements
  

  
It is used to define a railing type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The **IfcRailingType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcRailingType** are
represented by instances of _IfcRailing_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcRailing_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
