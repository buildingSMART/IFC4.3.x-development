IfcRampFlightType
=================
The building element type **IfcRampFlightType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of ramp flights. The set of shared information may
include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
  
It is used to define a ramp flight type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The **IfcRampFlightType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcRampFlightType** are
represented by instances of _IfcRampFlight_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcRampFlight_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
