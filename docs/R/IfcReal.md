IfcReal
=======
_IfcReal_ is a defined type of simple data type REAL. It is required since a
select type (_IfcSimpleValue_), cannot directly include simple types in its
select list.  
  
In principle, the domain of _IfcReal_ (being a Real) is all rational,
irrational and scientific real numbers. Here the precision is unconstrained,
but in practice it is implementation specific.
