IfcReinforcingElementType
=========================
The element component type **IfcReinforcingElementType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of reinforcing elements. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
  
It is used to define a reinforcing element type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcReinforcingElementType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcReinforcingElementType**
are represented by instances of _IfcReinforcingElement_.
