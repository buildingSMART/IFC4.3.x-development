IfcRelFlowControlElements
=========================
This objectified relationship between a distribution flow element occurrence
and one-to-many control element occurrences indicates that the control
element(s) sense or control some aspect of the flow element. It is applied to
_IfcDistributionFlowElement_ and _IfcDistributionControlElement_.  
  
This relationship may be used to indicate an operational relationship such as
an actuator operating a valve, damper, or switch. It may also be used to
indicate a sensing relationship such as a sensor detecting conditions of fluid
flow.  
  
This relationship implies a sensing or controlling relationship; if elements
are merely connected without any control relationship, then
_IfcRelConnectsElements_ should be used.
