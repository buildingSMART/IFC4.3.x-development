IfcRelProjectsElement
=====================
The _IfcRelProjectsElement_ is an objectified relationship between an element
and one projection element that creates a modifier to the shape of the
element. The relationship is defined to be a 1:1 relationship, if an element
has more than one projection, several relationship objects have to be used,
each pointing to a different projection element. The _IfcRelProjectsElement_
establishes an aggregation relationship between the main element and a sub
ordinary addition feature.  
  
> NOTE  In contrary the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship established an
> aggregation of equal parts to a whole.  
  
The _IfcRelProjectsElement_ implies a Boolean operation of addition for the
geometric bodies of the element and the feature element. As with all
decomposition relationships it determines:  
  
* existence dependency - the _RelatedFeatureElement_ cannot exist without the _RelatingElement_  
* hierarchical and non-cyclical relationship - the _IfcRelProjectsElement_ can only alter a single _IfcElement_  
* no spatial containment - the _IfcFeatureElementAddition_ as related element never participates in the hiearchical spatial containment relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_
