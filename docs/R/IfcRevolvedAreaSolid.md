IfcRevolvedAreaSolid
====================
An _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ is a solid created by revolving a cross section
provided by a profile definition about an axis.  
  
The resulting solid is positioned by the _IfcSweptAreaSolid_._Position_
relative to the object coordinate system. If provided, it allows to reposition
the revolved solid. If not provided, it defaults to the current object
coordinate system. The axis and the cross section shall be in the same plane,
prior to any repositioning.  
  
> NOTE  Both the axis and the cross section are required to lie in the xy
> plane of the object position coordinate system.

{ .extDef}  
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A revolved area solid is a solid formed by revolving a planar bounded
> surface about an axis. The axis shall be in the plane of the surface and the
> axis shall not intersect the interior of the bounded surface. The bounded
> surface may have holes which will sweep into holes in the solid. The
> direction of revolution is clockwise when viewed along the axis in the
> positive direction. More precisely if **A** is the axis location and **d**
> is the axis direction and **C** is an arc on the surface of revolution
> generated by an arbitrary point **p** on the boundary of the swept area,
> then **C** leaves **p** in direction **d** x (**p** - **A**) as the area is
> revolved.

Informal Propositions:  
  
1\. The _AxisLine_ shall lie in the plane of the _SweptArea_ (as defined at
supertype _IfcSweptAreaSolid_).  
2\. The _AxisLine_ shall not intersect the interior of the _SweptArea_ (as
defined at supertype _IfcSweptAreaSolid_).  
3\. The _Angle_ shall be between 0° and 360°, or 0 and 2π (depending on the
unit type for _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_).

Texture Use Definition  
  
For side faces, textures are aligned facing upright along the sides with
origin at the first point of an arbitrary profile, and following the outer
bound of the profile counter-clockwise (as seen from above). For parameterized
profiles, the origin is defined at the +Y extent for rounded profiles (having
no sharp edge) and the first sharp edge counter-clockwise from the +Y extent
for all other profiles. Textures are stretched or repeated on each side along
the outer boundary of the profile according to _RepeatS_. Textures are
stretched or repeated on each side along the outermost (longest) revolution
path according to _RepeatT_, where coordinates are compressed towards the axis
of revolution.  
  
For top and bottom caps, textures are aligned facing front-to-back, with the
origin at the minimum X and Y extent. Textures are stretched or repeated on
the top and bottom to the extent of each face according to _RepeatS_ and
_RepeatT_.  
  
For profiles with voids, textures are aligned facing upright along the inner
side with origin at the first point of an arbitrary profile, and following the
inner bound of the profile clockwise (as seen from above). For parameterized
profiles, the origin of inner sides is defined at the +Y extent for rounded
profiles (having no sharp edge such as hollow ellipses or rounded rectangles)
and the first sharp edge clockwise from the +Y extent for all other profiles.
