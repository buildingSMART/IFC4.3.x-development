IfcSanitaryTerminalType
=======================
The flow terminal type **IfcSanitaryTerminalType** defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of sanitary terminals. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a sanitary terminal type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcSanitaryTerminalType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcSanitaryTerminalType**
are represented by instances of _IfcSanitaryTerminal_. Refer to the
documentation at _IfcSanitaryTerminal_ for supported property sets, materials,
composition, and ports.
