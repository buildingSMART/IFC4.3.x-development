A sign is a notice on display that gives information or instructions in a
written, symbolic or other form. Signs are passive with the most common form
of a pictorial panel. An instance of

occurrence of an individual panel which can be applied to a surface such as a
wall or be aggregated within a Signal Assembly which can include multiple sign
occurrences and the associated supporting structural elements (see Signal
Assembly for examples).
