or building element.

Relationship use definition  
  
Structural actions are grouped into either an _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ of
predefined type LOAD_GROUP or, more often, an _IfcStructuralLoadCase_. This is
accomplished via the inverse relationship _HasAssignments_ and an
_IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ relationship object.
_IfcStructuralLoadGroup.LoadGroupFor_ or _IfcStructuralLoadCase.LoadGroupFor_
respectively refers to the structural analysis model(s) in which the loads are
used.  
  
It is furthermore possible to establish relationships between actions in one
analysis model and reactions in another analysis model which cause the
actions. For example, a support reaction from one structural system may be
taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system. This is
expressed by means of the inverse relationship _ReferencedBy_ of the action
and an _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ relationship object.
_IfcRelAssignsToProduct.Name_ is set to ''Causes'' and
_IfcRelAssignsToProduct.RelatedObjects_ refers to an instance of a subtype of
_IfcStructuralReaction_.
