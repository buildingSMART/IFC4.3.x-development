IfcStructuralLoadGroup
======================
The entity _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ is used to structure the physical impacts.
By using the grouping features inherited from _IfcGroup_, instances of
_IfcStructuralAction_ (or its subclasses) and of _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ can
be used to define load groups, load cases and load combinations. (See also
_IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum_.)  
  
> NOTE  Important functionality for the description of a load-bearing system
> is derived from the existing IFC entity _IfcGroup_. This class provides, via
> the relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, the needed grouping
> mechanism. In this way, instances of _IfcStructuralAction_ belonging to a
> specific load group can be unambiguously determined.  
  
> NOTE  The relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ is used to group
> load cases into load combinations. The factor provided in this assignment
> relationship is to applied together with the optional
> _IfcStructuralLoadGroup.Coefficient_. Unlike this coefficient which always
> affects the load group, the _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor.Factor_ is
> specific for a load case--load combination pair. As many instances of
> _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ are used within one load combination as there
> are different _Factor_s to be applied to load cases in the load combination.
> On the other hand, a load case may appear in more than one load combination
> and can have a different _Factor_ in each assignment by
> _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_.

Informal Propositions:  
  
1\. Load groups of type LOAD_GROUP shall only contain instances of
_IfcStructuralAction_.  
2\. Load groups of type LOAD_CASE shall always be instantiated from the
subtype _IfcStructuralLoadCase_, not directly from the generic type
_IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ itself.  
3\. Instances of _IfcStructuralLoadCase_ shall only contain instances of
_IfcStructuralAction_ or/ and instances of _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ of type
LOAD_GROUP.  
4\. Load groups of type LOAD_COMBINATION shall only contain instances of
_IfcStructuralLoadCase_.

|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ActionType   | Type of actions in the group. Normally needed if ''PredefinedType'' specifies a LOAD_CASE.                                                                                                                  |
| ActionSource | Source of actions in the group. Normally needed if ''PredefinedType'' specifies a LOAD_CASE.                                                                                                                |
| Coefficient  | Load factor. If omitted, a factor is not yet known or not specified. A load factor of 1.0 shall be explicitly exported as Coefficient = 1.0.                                                                |
| Purpose      | Description of the purpose of this instance. Among else, possible values of the Purpose of load combinations are ''SLS'', ''ULS'', ''ALS'' to indicate serviceability, ultimate, or accidental limit state. |
