IfcSubContractResourceType
==========================
The resource type _IfcSubContractResourceType_ defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of subcontract resources. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common productivities  
* common cost rates  
* common properties within shared property sets  
  
It is used to define a subcontract resource specification (the specific
resource information that is common to all occurrences of that resource).
Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.  
  
Occurrences of the _IfcSubContractResourceType_ are represented by instances
of _IfcSubContractResource_.
