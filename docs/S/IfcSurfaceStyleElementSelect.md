IfcSurfaceStyleElementSelect
============================
The _IfcSurfaceStyleElementSelect_ provides a selection between different
surface styles, including _IfcSurfaceStyleRendering_ for rendering properties,
_IfcSurfaceStyleLighting_, which holds the exact physically based lighting
properties for lighting based calculation algorithms (as the opposite to the
rendering based calculation), the _IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction_ (for more
advanced refraction indices) and _IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures_ to allow for
image textures applied to surfaces. In addition an
_IfcExternallyDefinedSurfaceStyle_ can be selected that points into an
external rendering material library.  
  
> NOTE  The _IfcSurfaceLightingProperties_ are needed for exact lighting
> calculation, because physically based lighting calculation algorithms need
> exact physically based parameters. The factors in _IfcSurfaceStyleRendering_
> lack the physical base, they are intended for rendering calculations, but a
> lighting calculation based software cannot use these values.
