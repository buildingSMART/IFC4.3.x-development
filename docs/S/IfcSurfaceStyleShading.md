IfcSurfaceStyleShading
======================
The _IfcSurfaceStyleShading_ allows for colour information and transparency
used for shading and simple rendering. The surface colour is used for
colouring or simple shading of the assigned surfaces and the transparency for
identifying translucency, where 0.0 is completely opaque, and 1.0 is
completely transparent.
