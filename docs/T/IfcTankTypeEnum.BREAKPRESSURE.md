IfcTankTypeEnum.BREAKPRESSURE
=============================
An open container that breaks the hydraulic pressure in a distribution system,
typically located between the fluid reservoir and the fluid supply points. A
typical break pressure tank allows the flow to discharge into the atmosphere,
thereby reducing its hydrostatic pressure to zero.
