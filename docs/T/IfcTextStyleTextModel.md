IfcTextStyleTextModel
=====================
The _IfcTextStyleTextModel_ combines all text style properties, that affect
the presentation of a text literal within a given extent. It includes the
spacing between characters and words, the horizontal and vertical alignment of
the text within the planar box of the extent, decorations (like underline),
transformations of the literal (like uppercase), and the height of each text
line within a multi-line text block.

| TextAlign      | This property describes how text is aligned horizontally within the element. The actual justification algorithm used is dependent on the rendering algorithm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| TextDecoration | This property describes decorations that are added to the text of an element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| LetterSpacing  | The length unit indicates an addition to the default space between characters. Values can be negative, but there may be implementation-specific limits. The importing application is free to select the exact spacing algorithm. The letter spacing may also be influenced by justification (which is a value of the _TextAlign_ attribute).\X\0D> NOTE  The following values are allowed, _IfcDescriptiveMeasure_ with value=''normal'', _IfcRatioMeasure_, or _IfcLengthMeasure_, where the length unit is globally defined at _IfcUnitAssignment_.                                                                                                                      |
| WordSpacing    | The length unit indicates an addition to the default space between words. Values can be negative, but there may be implementation-specific limits. The importing application is free to select the exact spacing algorithm. The word spacing may also be influenced by justification (which is a value of the ''text-align'' property).\X\0D \X\0D> NOTE  It has been introduced for later compliance to full CSS support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| TextTransform  | This property describes how text characters may transform to upper case, lower case, or capitalized case, independent of the character case used in the text literal.\X\0D \X\0D> NOTE  It has been introduced for later compliance to full CSS support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| LineHeight     | The property sets the distance between two adjacent lines'' baselines. \X\0DWhen a ratio value is specified, the line height is given by the font size of the current element multiplied with the numerical value. A value of ''normal'' sets the line height to a reasonable value for the element''s font. It is suggested that importing applications set the ''normal'' value to be a ratio number in the range of 1.0 to 1.2.\X\0D \X\0D> NOTE  The following values are allowed: _IfcDescriptiveMeasure_ with value=''normal'', or _IfcLengthMeasure_, with non-negative values, the length unit is globally defined at _IfcUnitAssignment_, or _IfcRatioMeasure_.__ |
