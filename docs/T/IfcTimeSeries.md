IfcTimeSeries
=============
A time series is a set of a time-stamped data entries. It allows a natural
association of data collected over intervals of time. Time series can be
regular or irregular. In regular time series data arrive predictably at
predefined intervals. In irregular time series some or all time stamps do not
follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at
unspecified points in time.  
  
The modeling of buildings and their performance involves data that are
generated and recorded over a period of time. Such data cover a large
spectrum, from weather data to schedules of all kinds to status measurements
to reporting to everything else that has a time related aspect. Their correct
placement in time is essential for their proper understanding and use, and the
_IfcTimeSeries_ subtypes provide the appropriate data structures to
accommodate these types of data.
