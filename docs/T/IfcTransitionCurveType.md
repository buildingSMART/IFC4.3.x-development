IfcTransitionCurveType
======================
The _IfcTransitionCurveType_ indicates the curvature of a transition curve.  
  
Resulting cartesian coordinates (relative to starting position and
orientation) are given by equations herein, where _l_ (lowercase) refers to
the distance along the curve segment, L refers to the length of the curve
segment (_IfcCurveSegment2D_._Length_), and R refers to the radius at the
circular end of the curve segment (e.g.
_IfcTransitionCurveSegment2D_._EndRadius_).
