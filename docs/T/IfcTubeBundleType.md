IfcTubeBundleType
=================
The energy conversion device type **IfcTubeBundleType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of tube bundles. The set of shared
information may include:  
  
* common properties with shared property sets  
* common representations  
* common materials  
* common composition of elements  
* common ports  
  
It is used to define a tube bundle type specification indicating the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type.
The **IfcTubeBundleType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcTubeBundleType** are
represented by instances of _IfcTubeBundle_. Refer to the documentation at
_IfcTubeBundle_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and
ports.
