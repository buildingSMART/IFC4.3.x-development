IfcVibrationIsolatorType
========================
The element component type **IfcVibrationIsolatorType** defines commonly
shared information for occurrences of vibration isolators. The set of shared
information may include:  

  

  * common properties with shared property sets
  

  * common representations
  

  * common materials
  

  * common composition of elements
  

  
It is used to define a vibration isolator type specification indicating the
specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product
type. The **IfcVibrationIsolatorType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or
_IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or
without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcVibrationIsolatorType**
are represented by instances of _IfcVibrationIsolator_. Refer to the
documentation at _IfcVibrationIsolator_ for supported property sets,
materials, and composition.
