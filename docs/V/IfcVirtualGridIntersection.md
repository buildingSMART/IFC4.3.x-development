IfcVirtualGridIntersection
==========================
_IfcVirtualGridIntersection_ defines the derived location of the intersection
between two grid axes. Offset values may be given to set an offset distance to
the grid axis for the calculation of the virtual grid intersection.  
  
The two intersecting axes (_IntersectingAxes_) define the intersection point,
which exact location (in terms of the Cartesian point representing the
intersection) has to be calculated from the geometric representation of the
two participating curves.  
  
> NOTE  The _IfcGrid_ local placement, that can be provided relative to the
> local placement of another spatial structure element, has to be taken into
> account for calculating the absolute placement of the
> _IfcVirtualGridIntersection_. Where rules and informal rules ensure, that
> the _IntersectingAxes_ belong to the same _IfcGrid_  
  
Offset values may be given (_OffsetDistances_). If given, the position within
the list of _OffsetDistances_ corresponds with the position within the list of
_IntersectingAxes_. Therefore:  
  
* _OffsetDistances[1]_ sets the offset to _IntersectingAxes[1]_,  
* _OffsetDistances[2]_ sets the offset to _IntersectingAxes[2]_, and  
* _OffsetDistances[3]_ sets the offset to the virtual intersection in direction of the orientation of the cross product of _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and the orthogonal complement of the _IntersectingAxes[1]_ (which is the positive or negative direction of the z axis of the design grid position).  
  
The following figures explain the usage of the _OffsetDistances_ and
_IntersectingAxes_ attributes.

Figure 1 illustrates two offset distances given where the virtual intersection
is defined in the xy plane of the grid axis placement.

Figure 2 illustrates three offset distances given where the virtual
intersection is defined by an offset (in direction of the  
z-axis of the design grid placement) to the virtual intersection in the xy
plane of the grid axis placement.

The distance of the offset curve (_OffsetDistances[n]_) is measured from the
basis curve. The distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value
of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in
the sense of an anti-clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent
vector T at the given point. (This is in the direction of orthogonal
complement(T).) This can be reverted by the _SameSense_ attribute at
_IfcGridAxis_ which may switch the sense of the _AxisCurve_.

Figure 3 illustrates an example of a negative offset where the figure shows
the side of the offset.

  

  

  *  _IntersectingAxes[1].AxisCurve_ is an  
 _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with an _IfcCircle_ as  
 _BasisCurve_ and _SenseAgreement_ = TRUE.

  

  *  _IntersectingAxes[1].SameSense_ = TRUE.
  

  *  _OffsetDistances[1]_ is a negative length measure

Informal Propositions:  
  
1\. Both, _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and _IntersectingAxes[2]_ shall be two
_IfcGridAxis_ defined by the same _IfcGrid_.  
2\. _IntersectingAxes[1]_ and _IntersectingAxes[2]_ shall not be part of the
same row of grid axes, i.e. both shall not be within the same set of
_IfcGrid.UAxes_ or _IfcGrid.VAxes_ of the corresponding _IfcGrid_.
