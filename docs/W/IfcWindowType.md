IfcWindowType
=============
The element type _IfcWindowType_ defines commonly shared information for
occurrences of windows. The set of shared information may include:  
  
* common properties within shared property sets  
* common material information  
* common partitioning of panels  
* common operation types of panels  
* common shape representations  
  
A window type defines the particular parameter of the lining and one (or
several) panels through the _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and the
_IfcWindowPanelProperties_ as predefined property sets applicable to windows
only.  
  
It is used to define a window specification, or window style (the specific
product information that is common to all occurrences of that window type).
Window types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.  
  
Occurrences of the _IfcWindowType_ within building models are represented by
instances of _IfcWindow_ or _IfcWindowStandardCase_.  
  
> HISTORY  New entity in IFC4. The entity _IfcWindowType_ replaces the
> previous definition _IfcWindowStyle_ (which is deprecated in IFC4).

Partitioning type use definition  
  
The _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ defines the general layout of the window
type and its symbolic presentation. Depending on the enumerator, the
appropriate instances of _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and
_IfcWindowPanelProperties_ are attached in the list of _HasPropertySets_. The
_IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ mainly determines the way of partitioning the
window into individual window panels and thereby number and position of window
panels.  
  
See geometry use definitions at _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ for the
correct usage of panel partitioning and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ for the
opening symbols for different panel operation types.

Material Use Definition  
  
The material of the _IfcWindowType_ is defined by the
_IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by
the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the
inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.  
  
The following keywords for
_IfcMaterialConstituentSet.MaterialConstituents[n].Name_ shall be used:  
  
* ''Lining'' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the window lining  
* ''Framing'' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the window panels, if not provided, the ''Lining'' material information applied to panels as well  
* ''Glazing'' - to indicate that the material constituent applies to to the glazing part  
  
If the fall back single _IfcMaterial_ is referenced, it applies to the lining
and framing of the window.

Geometry Use Definitions:  
  
The _IfcWindowType_ may define the common shape of window occurrences. The
common shape can be defined by  
  
* applying shape parameters defined within the associated _IfcWindowLiningProperties_ and _IfcWindowPanelProperties_ applied to the ''Profile'' geometric representation. It is only applicable if the _IfcWindowType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcWindowStandardCase_ (See geometric use definition of _IfcWindowStandardCase_ for further information).  
* applying the _RepresentationMaps_ attribute to refer to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_''s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_''s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ ''Box'', ''Profile'', ''FootPrint'', or ''Body'')   
>> NOTE  The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_
(attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an
element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being
an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.  
>> NOTE  The values of attributes _RepresentationIdentifier_ and
_RepresentationType_ of _IfcShapeRepresentation_ are restricted in the same
way as those for _IfcWindow_ and _IfcWindowStandardCase_

| ParameterTakesPrecedence    | The Boolean value reflects, whether the parameter given in the attached lining and panel properties exactly define the geometry (TRUE), or whether the attached style shape take precedence (FALSE). In the last case the parameter have only informative value. If not provided, no such information can be infered. |
| UserDefinedPartitioningType | Designator for the user defined partitioning type, shall only be provided, if the value of _PartitioningType_ is set to USERDEFINED.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
