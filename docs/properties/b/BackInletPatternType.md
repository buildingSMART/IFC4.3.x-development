BackInletPatternType
====================

Identifies the pattern of inlet connections to a gully trap.

A gulley trap may have 0,1,2,3 or 4 inlet connections and the pattern of their arrangement may vary. The enumeration makes the convention that an outlet is either vertical or is placed at the bottom (south side) of the gully trap (when viewed in plan). Position 1 is to the left (west), position 2 is to the top (north), position 3 is to the right (east) and position 4 is to the bottom (south).
