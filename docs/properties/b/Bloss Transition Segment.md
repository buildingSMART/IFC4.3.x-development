Bloss Transition Segment
========================

The Bloss transition segment is a special case of a fifht order spiral where the curvature rate of change is a cubic function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

Only the cubic and quadratic terms are populated with the following values:
QubicTerm = L/³√2
QuadraticTerm = L/√3
