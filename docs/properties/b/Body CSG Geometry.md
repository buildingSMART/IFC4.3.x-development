Body CSG Geometry
=================

The _Body CSG Geometry_ is the representation of the 3D shape of a product by Constructive Solid Geometry models.

The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'CSG'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcCSGSolid_

> NOTE&nbsp; The _Items__IfcBooleanResult_ and _IfcPrimitive3D_ shall also be allowed for compatibility with previous releases of the standard.
