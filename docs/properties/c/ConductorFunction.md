ConductorFunction
=================

Function of a line conductor to which a device  is intended to be connected where L1, L2 and L3 represent the phase lines according to IEC 60446 notation (sometimes phase lines may be referenced by color [Red, Blue, Yellow] or by number [1, 2, 3] etc). Protective Earth is sometimes also known as CPC or common protective conductor. Note that for an electrical device, a set of line conductor functions may be applied.
