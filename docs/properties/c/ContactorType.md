ContactorType
=============

A list of the available types of contactor from which that required may be selected where:

CapacitorSwitching: for switching 3 phase single or multi-step capacitor banks.
LowCurrent: requires the use of low resistance contacts.
MagneticLatching: enables the contactor to remain in the on position when the coil is no longer energized.
MechanicalLatching: requires that the contactor is mechanically retained in the on position.
Modular: are totally enclosed and self contained.
Reversing: has a double set of contactors that are prewired.
Standard: is a generic device that controls the flow of power in a circuit on or off.
