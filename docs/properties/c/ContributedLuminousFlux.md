ContributedLuminousFlux
=======================

Luminous flux is a photometric measure of radiant flux, i.e. the volume of light emitted from a light source. Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp.
