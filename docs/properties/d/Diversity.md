Diversity
=========

The ratio, expressed as a numerical
value or as a percentage, of the
simultaneous maximum demand of
a group of electrical appliances or
consumers within a specified period,
to the sum of their individual maximum
demands within the same
period. The group of electrical appliances is in this case connected to this circuit. Definition from IEC 60050, IEV 691-10-04
NOTE1: It is often not desirable to size each conductor in a distribution system to support the total connected load at that point in the network. Diversity is applied on the basis of the anticipated loadings that are likely to result from all loads not being connected at the same time.
NOTE2: Diversity is applied to final circuits only, not to sub-main circuits supplying other DBs.
