ElevationOfSSLRelative
======================

Elevation of the top surface of the structural slab level given in elevation above the local zero height. If the level varies and there is no significantly more prominent elevation, then this property may be omitted. In case of any inconsistency with the geometric positioning of the top surface, the geometric representation takes precedence.
