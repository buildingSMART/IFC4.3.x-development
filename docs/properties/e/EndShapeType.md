EndShapeType
============

Defines the types of end shapes that can be used for preformed tanks. The convention for reading these enumerated values is that for a vertical cylinder, the first value is the base and the second is the top; for a horizontal cylinder, the order of reading should be left to right. For a speherical tank, the value UNSET should be used.
