EscortRequirement
=================

Indicates whether or not an escort is required to accompany persons carrying out a work order at or to/from the place of work (= TRUE) or not (= FALSE).

NOTE - There are many instances where escorting is required, particularly in a facility that has a high security rating. Escorting may require that persons are escorted to and from the place of work. Alternatively, it may involve the escort remaining at the place of work at all times.
