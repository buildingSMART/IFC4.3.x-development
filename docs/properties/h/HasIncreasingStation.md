HasIncreasingStation
====================

Inform on the increasing or decreasing progress of stationing values, for referents nested in a given alignment.

If present and true, or if not present, then the relevant subsequently nested referents are expected to have greater _Pset_Stationing.Station_ values (i.e., increasing stations).

If present and false, then the relevant subsequently nested referents are expected to have lower _Pset_Stationing.Station_ values (i.e., decreasing stations).
