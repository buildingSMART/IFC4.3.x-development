IK Code according to IEC 62262 (2002) is a numeric classification for the degree of protection provided by enclosures for electrical equipment against external mechanical impacts.
> NOTE  In earlier labeling, the third numeral (1..) had been occasionally added to the closely related IP Code on ingress protection, to indicate the level of impact protection.
