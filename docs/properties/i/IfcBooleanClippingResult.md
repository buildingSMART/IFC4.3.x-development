IfcBooleanClippingResult
========================

A clipping result is defined as a special subtype of the general _IfcBooleanResult_. It constrains the operands and the operator of the Boolean result.

A clipping result is the Boolean difference between a swept solid and a half space solid, or between the result of the Boolean difference and a half space solid. Hence more than one difference operation can be applied to achieve the final Boolean result.
