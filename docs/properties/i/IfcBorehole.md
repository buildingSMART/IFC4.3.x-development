IfcBorehole
===========

Representation of the concept of a linear geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement  
The assembly may contain one of more strata and other elements such as capping and lining. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from straight or bent tubes reflecting the bore diameter, or discs if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.
