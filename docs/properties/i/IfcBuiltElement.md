This _IfcBuiltElement_ is a generalization of all elements that participate in a building system. Typical examples of _IfcBuiltElement_'s are (among others):  

* built elements within a space separation systems
* built elements within an enclosure system (such as a facade)
* built elements within a fenestration system
* built elements within a load bearing system
* built elements within a foundation system

  
> EXAMPLE&nbsp; built elements are walls, curtain wall, doors, columns, pile, and others.  
 
The IfcBuiltElement can be instantiated in the case when arbitrary built elements cannot be expressed by a subtype of IfcBuiltElement.
