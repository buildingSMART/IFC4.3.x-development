=======

A coil is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media. A common example is a cooling coil, which utilizes a finned coil in which circulates chilled water, antifreeze, or refrigerant that is used to remove heat from air moving across the surface of the coil. A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.

Coils may also be used for non-airflow cases such as embedded in a floor slab.
