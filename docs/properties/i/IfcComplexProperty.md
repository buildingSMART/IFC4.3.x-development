IfcComplexProperty
==================

_IfcComplexProperty_ is used to define complex properties to be handled completely within a property set. The included set of properties may be a mixed or consistent collection of _IfcProperty_ subtypes. This enables the definition of a set of properties to be included as a single 'property' entry in an _IfcPropertySet_. The definition of such an _IfcComplexProperty_ can be reused in many different _IfcPropertySet_'s.

> NOTE&nbsp; Since an _IfcComplexProperty_ may contain other complex properties, sets of properties can be nested. This nesting may be restricted by view definitions and implementer agreements.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0.
