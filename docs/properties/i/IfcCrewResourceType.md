IfcCrewResourceType
===================

The resource type _IfcCrewResourceType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of crew resources. The set of shared information may include:

* common productivities
* common cost rates
* common properties within shared property sets

It is used to define a crew resource specification (the specific resource information that is common to all occurrences of that resource). Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcCrewResourceType_ are represented by instances of _IfcCrewResource_.
