IfcDistributionBoardType
========================

The flow controller type _IfcDistributionBoardType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of distribution boards. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
* common ports

It is used to define a distribution board type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The _IfcDistributionBoardType_ may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of _IfcDistributionBoardType_ are represented by instances of _IfcDistributionBoard_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcDistributionBoard_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
