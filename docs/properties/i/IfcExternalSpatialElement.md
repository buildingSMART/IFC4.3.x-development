IfcExternalSpatialElement
=========================

The external spatial element defines external regions at the building site. Those regions can be defined:

* logically - for example, an instance of _IfcExternalSpatialElement_ could represent the air space around the building without having an own shape representation, or
* physically - for example, an instance of _IfcExternalSpatialElement_ could represent the sloping ground around the building to identify the part of the external building envelop that is below ground.
