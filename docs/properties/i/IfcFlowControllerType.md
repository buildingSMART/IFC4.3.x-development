IfcFlowControllerType
=====================

The element type _IfcFlowControllerType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow controller and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow controller specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

A flow controller type is used to define the common properties of a flow controller that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow controller is a device that regulates flow within a distribution system, such as a valve in a piping system, modulating damper in an air distribution system, or electrical switch in an electrical distribution system. Flow controller types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcFlowControllerType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowController_ or its subtypes.
