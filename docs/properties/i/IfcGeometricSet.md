IfcGeometricSet
===============

The _IfcGeometricSet_ is used for the exchange of shape representation consisting of (2D or 3D) points, curves, and surfaces, which do not have a topological structure (such as connected face sets or shells), are not tessellated and are not solid models (such as swept solids, CSG or Brep).
