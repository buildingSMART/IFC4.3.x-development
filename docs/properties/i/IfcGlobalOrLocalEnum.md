IfcGlobalOrLocalEnum
====================

This enumeration type defines if the local object coordinate system or the global world coordinate system for the project is used to describe the measure values of entities which have a reference to this type.

> NOTE&nbsp; The world coordinate system is given by the _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.WorldCoordinateSystem_ and is unique within the project. The local (or object) coordinate system is given by_IfcProduct.ObjectPlacement_ and is used by all _IfcRepresentation_'s within the _IfcProduct.Representation_.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New enumeration in IFC2x2.
