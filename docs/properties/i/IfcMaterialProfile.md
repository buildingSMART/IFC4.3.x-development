IfcMaterialProfile
==================

_IfcMaterialProfile_ is a single and identifiable cross section of an element which is constructed of a number of profiles (one or more).

> NOTE&nbsp; In case of multiple _MaterialProfiles_, the relative positioning of individual profiles in _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ are defined using the concept of _IfcCompositeProfileDef_ in _IfcProfileResource_ schema; otherwise, only one _MaterialProfile_ is given and defined by an individual _IfcProfileDef_ (subtype).
