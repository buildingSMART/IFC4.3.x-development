IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets
=============================

_IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ is a specialization of _IfcMaterialProfile_ with additional longitudinal offsets .

Relative positions of _IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ in the longitudinal direction of an element can be defined giving offsets at the start at the end, or at start and end. This shall not be used for relative positions of individual profiles in the plane of profile definition, which is given in composite profile definition itself. Also, care should be taken especially when used with _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageTapering_ for correct start and end offset assignment.
