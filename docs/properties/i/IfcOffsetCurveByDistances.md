IfcOffsetCurveByDistances
=========================

An _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ is a curve defined by a list of offsets along its _BasisCurve_. If only one offset is provided, it indicates a constant offset along the extents of the basis curve.

Figure 1 illustrates eight instances of _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ (in green) defined relative to an _IfcAlignmentCurve_ (in blue).
