IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum
===========================

The _IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum_ specifically defines the range of different breaker unit types that can be used in conjunction with protective device. Types may also be used as a reference to a complete protective device in circumstances where tripping units are not separately identified (typically expected to be the case during earlier stages of design).

> HISTORY&nbsp; New type in IFC2x2. Modified definition and usage in IFC4.
