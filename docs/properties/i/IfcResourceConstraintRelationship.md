IfcResourceConstraintRelationship
=================================

An _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_ is a relationship entity that enables a constraint to be related to one or more resource level objects.

An _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_ allows for the specification of a constraint to be applied to many entity types. An important case is to apply constraints to properties. The constraints applied therefore enable a property to carry values identifying requirements as well as those identifying the fulfilment of those requirements.
