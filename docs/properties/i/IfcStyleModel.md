IfcStyleModel
=============

_IfcStyleModel_ represents the concept of a particular presentation style defined for a material (or other characteristic) of a product or a product component within a representation context. This representation context may (but has not to be) a geometric representation context.

_IfcStyleModel_ can be a style representation (presentation style) of a material (via _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_), potentially differentiated for different representation contexts (for example, different material hatching depending on the scale of the target representation context).
