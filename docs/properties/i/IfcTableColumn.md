IfcTableColumn
==============

An _IfcTableColumn_ is a data structure that captures column information for use in an _IfcTable_. Each instance defines the identifier, name, description, and units of measure that are applicable to the columnar data associated with the _IfcTableRow_ objects.

The use of _IfcTableColumn_ supersedes the _IsHeading_ flag associated with _IfcTableRow_.
