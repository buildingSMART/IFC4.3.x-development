IfcTransformer
==============

A transformer is an inductive stationary device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another.

_IfcTransformer_ is used to transform electric power; conversion of electric signals for other purposes is handled at other entities: _IfcController_ converts arbitrary signals, _IfcAudioVisualAppliance_ converts signals for audio or video streams, and _IfcCommunicationsAppliance_ converts signals for data or other communications usage.
