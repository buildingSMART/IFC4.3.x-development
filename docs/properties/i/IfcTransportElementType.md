IfcTransportElementType
=======================

The element type _IfcTransportElementType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of transport elements. The set of shared information may include: 
 
* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common shape representations

  
It is used to define a transport element specification (i.e. the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that beam type). Transport element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.  
The occurrences of the _IfcTransportElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcTransportElement_  (or its subtypes).
