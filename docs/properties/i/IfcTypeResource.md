IfcTypeResource
===============

_IfcTypeResource_ defines a specific (or type) definition of a resource. It is used to define a resource specification (the specific resource, that is common to all occurrences that are defined for that resource) and could act as a resource template.

An _IfcTypeResource_ may have a list of property sets attached. Values of these properties are common to all occurrences of that resource type. The type occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_.

Subtypes of _IfcTypeResource_ may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of _IfcResource_.
