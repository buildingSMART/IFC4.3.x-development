ImaginaryImpedanceRatio
=======================

The ratio between the imaginary part of the zero sequence impedance and the imaginary part of the positive impedance (i.e. imaginary part of the short-circuit voltage) of the transformer.
Used for three-phase transformer which includes a N-conductor.
