IsForSullageWater
=================

Indicates if the purpose of the floor trap is to receive sullage water, or if that is amongst its purposes (= TRUE), or not (= FALSE). Note that if TRUE, it is expected that an upstand or kerb will be placed around the floor trap to prevent the ingress of surface water runoff; the provision of the upstand or kerb is not dealt with in this property set.
