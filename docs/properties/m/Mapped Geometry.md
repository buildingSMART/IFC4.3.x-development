Mapped Geometry
===============

Elements may have a 'Mapped Geometry' representation that reuses the concept _Product Type Shape_ at the corresponding product type, as defined by the concept _Object Typing_.

The representation identifier of the mapped geometry representation is any of the other valid geometric representation identifiers, such as 'Body', 'FootPrint', or 'Axis'.

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = (any, see above)
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ = 'MappedRepresentation'
