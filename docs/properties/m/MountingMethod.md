MountingMethod
==============

The method of mounting cable segment occurrences on a cable carrier occurrence from which the method required can be selected. This is for the purpose of carrying out 'worst case' cable sizing calculations and may be a conceptual requirement rather than a statement of the physical occurrences of cable and carrier segments.
