NumberOfStoreys
===============

The number of storeys within a building.
Captured for those cases where the _IfcBuildingStorey_ entity is not used. Note that if _IfcBuildingStorey_ is asserted and the number of storeys in a building can be determined from it, then this approach should be used in preference to setting a property for the number of storeys.
