PieceMark
=========

Defines a unique piece for production purposes. All pieces with the same piece mark value are identical and interchangeable. The piece mark may be composed of sub-parts that have specific locally defined meaning (e.g. B-1A may denote a beam, of generic type ‘1’ and specific shape ‘A’).
