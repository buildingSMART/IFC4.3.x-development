PolyCurve Profile Definition
============================

Poly curve profile definitons define the closed two-dimensional curve used for the cross-section by a indexed poly curve having straight and circular arc segments.

> NOTE&nbsp; The indexed poly curve has been introduced to provide a less complex and less data set size consuming definition compared to the composite curve.
