Project Classification Information
==================================

Projects may define classification structures, which may be used to classify objects contained within the same project, or other referencing projects (incorporating the current project as _IfcProjectLibrary_).

The classification information can either be provided as an external classification reference, only refering to an _IfcClassification_, that holds the classification name, edition and a resource location, or to an _IfcClassification_ containing the _IfcClassificationReference_'s as the classification notations, and thereby allowing to include the classification system structure within the exchange structure.
