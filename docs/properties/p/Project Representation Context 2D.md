Project Representation Context 2D
=================================

The main geometric representation context that is created for 2D representations, it can be further refined using geometric representation sub contexts for specific 2D contexts.

> NOTE&nbsp; The 2D shape representations with the representation identifier "FootPrint" are linked to the 2D geometric representation subset with context identifier "FootPrint" and context type "Plan".
