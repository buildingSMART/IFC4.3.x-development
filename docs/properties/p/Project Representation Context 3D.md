Project Representation Context 3D
=================================

The main geometric representation context that is created for 3D representations, it can be further refined using geometric representation sub contexts for specific 3D contexts.

> NOTE&nbsp; The 3D shape representations with the representation identifier "Body" are linked to the 3D geometric representation subset with context identifier "Body" and context type "Model".
