ShadingCoefficient
==================

(SC): The measure of the ability of a glazing to transmit solar heat, relative to that ability for 3 mm (1/8-inch) clear, double-strength, single glass. Shading coefficient is being phased out in favor of the solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), and is approximately equal to the SHGC multiplied by 1.15. The shading coefficient is expressed as a number without units between 0 and 1.
