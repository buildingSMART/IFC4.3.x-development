SkirtingBoard
=============

Label to indicate the material or construction of the skirting board around the space flooring. The label is used for room book information.

The material information is provided in absence of an IfcCovering (type=SKIRTINGBOARD) object with own shape representation and material assignment. In case of inconsistency the material assigned to IfcCovering elements takes precedence.
