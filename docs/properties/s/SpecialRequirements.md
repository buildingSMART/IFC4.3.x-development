SpecialRequirements
===================

Any additional special requirements that need to be included in the permit to work.

NOTE - Additional permit requirements may be imposed according to the nature of the facility at which the work is carried out. For instance, in clean areas, special clothing may be required whilst in corrective institutions, it may be necessary to check in and check out tools that will be used for work as a safety precaution.
