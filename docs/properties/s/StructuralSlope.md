StructuralSlope
===============

The nominal side slope (allowable steepness) of the pavement structure (not including side slope fill) as a positive ratio measure. The slope  information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In case of inconsistency between the geometric parameters take precedence. Value is typically less than 1.0 (1:1) but may be greater than that for steeper slopes.
