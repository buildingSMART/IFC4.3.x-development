SubNatureOfRisk1
================

A first subsidiary value that might be assigned to designate a more specific type of risk.

NOTE: Nature of risk may be identified in various ways depending upon the place where risk assessment takes place and according to local agreement. This property set allows for a generic nature of risk and up to two subsidiary natures. An example might be 'causing injury and damage'.
