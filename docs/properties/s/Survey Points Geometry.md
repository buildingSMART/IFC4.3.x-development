Survey Points Geometry
======================

Elements may provide a 'SurveyPoints' representation for defining a contour such as for _IfcSite_. It contains the survey points as a set of Cartesian points and optionally breaklines.

The representation identifier and type and the only allowed single representation item of the 'SurveyPoints' representation are:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'SurveyPoints'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._RepresentationType_ : 'GeometricCurveSet'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation_._Items_ = _IfcGeometricCurveSet_
