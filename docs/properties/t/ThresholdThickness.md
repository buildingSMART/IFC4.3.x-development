ThresholdThickness
==================

Thickness of the door threshold as explained in the figure above. If _ThresholdThickness_ value is 0. (zero) it denotes a door without a threshold (_ThresholdDepth_ shall be set to NIL in this case). If the _ThresholdThickness_ is NIL it denotes that the information about a threshold is not available.
