Topography Geometry
===================

Elements describing surface contours may provide a 'Topography' representation. This representation consists of _IfcCartesianPointList3D_ containing a set of points (in no particular order) having unique horizontal coordinates (X and Y axes), with potentially variable vertical coordinates (Z axis). This representation may also contain optional breaklines using _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_.
