TreadLengthAtInnerSide
======================

Minimum length of treads at the inner side of the winder. 
Only relevant in case of winding flights, for straight flights it is identical with IfcStairFlight.TreadLength. It is a pre-calculated value, in case of inconsistencies, the value derived from the shape representation shall take precedence.
