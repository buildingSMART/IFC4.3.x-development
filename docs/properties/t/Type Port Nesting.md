Type Port Nesting
=================

Ports may be specified on types, following the same rules as defined for corresponding occurrences.

On type objects, ports are not connected, but serve as placeholders indicating that occurrences of the enclosing type object shall use a duplicate list of ports for connecting to ports on other object occurrences.
