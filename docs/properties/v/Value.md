=====

The expected range and default value.  While the property data type is IfcReal (to support all cases including when the units are unknown), a unit may optionally be provided to indicate the measure and unit.  The LowerLimitValue and UpperLimitValue must fall within the physical Range and may be used to determine extents when charting Pset_ControllerPHistory.Value.
