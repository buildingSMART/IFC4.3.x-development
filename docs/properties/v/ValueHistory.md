Indicates values over time which may be recorded continuously or only when changed beyond a particular deadband.  The range of possible values is defined by the Value property on the corresponding occurrence property set (Pset_ControllerTypeFloating, Pset_ControllerTypeProportional, Pset_ControllerTypeMultiPosition, or Pset_ControllerTypeTwoPosition).
