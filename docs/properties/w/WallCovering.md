WallCovering
============

Label to indicate the material or finish of the space cladding. The label is used for room book information and often displayed in room stamp.

The material information is provided in absence of an _IfcCovering_ (type=CLADDING) object with own shape representation and material assignment. In case of inconsistency the material assigned to _IfcCovering_ elements takes precedence.
