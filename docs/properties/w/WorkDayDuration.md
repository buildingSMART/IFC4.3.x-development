WorkDayDuration
===============

The elapsed time within a worktime-based day. For presentation purposes, applications may choose to display IfcTask durations in work days where IfcTaskTime.DurationType=WORKTIME. This value must be less than or equal to 24 hours (an elapsed day); if omitted then 8 hours is assumed.
