WorkFinishTime
==============

The default time of day a task is scheduled to finish. For presentation purposes, if the finish time of a task matches the WorkFinishTime, then applications may choose to display the date only. Conversely when entering dates without specifying time, applications may automatically append the WorkFinishTime.
