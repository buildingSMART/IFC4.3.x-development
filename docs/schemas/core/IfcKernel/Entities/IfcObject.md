# IfcObject

An _IfcObject_ is the generalization of any semantically treated thing or process. Objects are things as they appear - i.e. occurrences.

> NOTE  Examples of _IfcObject_ include physically tangible items such as wall, beam or covering, physically existing items such as spaces, or conceptual items such as grids or virtual boundaries. It also stands for processes such as work tasks, for controls such as cost items, or for actors such as persons involved in the design process.

Objects can be named, using the inherited _Name_ attribute, which should be a user recognizable label for the object occurrence. Further explanations to the object can be given using the inherited _Description_ attribute. The _ObjectType_ attribute is used:

* to store the user defined value for all subtypes of _IfcObject_, where a _PredefinedType_ attribute is given, and its value is set to USERDEFINED.
* to provide a type information (could be seen as a very lightweight classifier) of the subtype of _IfcObject_, if no _PredefinedType_ attribute is given. This is often the case, if no comprehensive list of predefined types is available.

Objects are independent pieces of information that might contain or reference other pieces of information. There are several relationships in which objects can be involved:

* **Association to external/internal resource information** - an association relationship that refers to external/internal sources of information. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Assignment of other objects** - an assignment relationship that refers to other types of objects. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Aggregation of other objects** - an aggregation relationship that establishes a whole/part relation. Objects can either be a whole, or a part, or both. See supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_ for more information.
* **Assignment of a type** : _IsTypedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_ that uses a type definition to define the common characteristics of this occurrence, potentially including the common shape representation and common properties of all object occurrences assigned to this type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).
* **Assignment of a partial type** : _IsDeclaredBy_, _Declares_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ that uses a component of a type definition (a part of a type, called the "declaring part") to define a component of an occurrence (part of occurrence, called the "reflected part"). This is also referred to as a "deep copy". The common characteristics of all parts in the occurrence are defined by parts in the type. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the properties of the type, but may override them).
* **Assignment of property sets** : _IsDefinedBy_ - a definition relationship _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ that assigns property set definitions to the object occurrence.

> NOTE  See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for an explanatory figure. Also see there for how to override type properties by occurrence properties. See _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ for an explanatory figure for the assignment of a partial type.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  The inverse relationships _Declares_, _IsDeclaredBy_, and _IsTypedBy_ have been added. Types are no longer included in the _IsDefinesBy_ relationship. _IfcProject_ has been promoted to be a subtype of _IfcObjectDefinition_ -> _IfcContext_.

## Informal Propositions

1. A partial type assignment, i.e. the inverse attribute _IsDeclaredBy_, or _Declares_ shall only be used, if the object is part of a decomposition, i.e. if either _IsDecomposedBy_, or _Decomposes_ is exerted.

## Attributes

### ObjectType
The type denotes a particular type that indicates the object further. The use has to be established at the level of instantiable subtypes. In particular it holds the user defined type, if the enumeration of the attribute _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED or when the concrete entity instantiated does not have a PredefinedType attribute. The latter is the case in some exceptional leaf classes and when instantiating IfcBuiltElement directly. 

### IsDeclaredBy
Link to the relationship object pointing to the declaring object that provides the object definitions for this object occurrence. The declaring object has to be part of an object type decomposition. The associated _IfcObject_, or its subtypes, contains the specific information (as part of a type, or style, definition), that is common to all reflected instances of the declaring _IfcObject_, or its subtypes.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  New inverse relationship, change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

### Declares
Link to the relationship object pointing to the reflected object(s) that receives the object definitions. The reflected object has to be part of an object occurrence decomposition. The associated _IfcObject_, or its subtypes, provides the specific information (as part of a type, or style, definition), that is common to all reflected instances of the declaring _IfcObject_, or its subtypes.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  New inverse relationship, change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

### IsTypedBy
Set of relationships to the object type that provides the type definitions for this object occurrence. The then associated _IfcTypeObject_, or its subtypes, contains the specific information (or type, or style), that is common to all instances of _IfcObject_, or its subtypes, referring to the same type.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  New inverse relationship, the link to _IfcRelDefinesByType_ was previously included in the inverse relationship _IfcRelDefines_. Change made with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

### IsDefinedBy
Set of relationships to property set definitions attached to this object. Those statically or dynamically defined properties contain alphanumeric information content that further defines the object.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  The data type has been changed from _IfcRelDefines_ to _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

## Formal Propositions

### UniquePropertySetNames
Every individual _IfcPropertySetDefinition_ assigned to the object using _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ shall have a unique _Name_ attribute value.

## Concepts

### Object Predefined Type



### Object Typing

Any object occurrence can be typed by being assigned to a common object type utilizing this concept. A particular rule, restricting the applicable subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_ that can be assigned, is introduced by overriding this concept at the level of subtypes of _IfcObject_.

### Object User Identity

An attribute _Name_ and optionally _Description_ can be used for all subypes of _IfcObject_. For those subtypes, that have an object type definition, such as _IfcBeam_ - _IfcBeamType_, the common _Name_ and optionally _Description_ is associated with the object type.

### Property Sets with Override

Any object occurrence can hold property sets, either directly at the object occurrence as element specific property sets, or at the object type, as type property sets. In this case, the properties that are provided to the object occurrence are the combinations of element specific and type properties. In case that the same property (within the same property set) is defined both in occurrence and type properties, the property value of the occurrence property overrides the property value of the type property.
