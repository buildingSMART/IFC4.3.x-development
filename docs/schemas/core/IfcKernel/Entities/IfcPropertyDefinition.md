# IfcPropertyDefinition

_IfcPropertyDefinition_ defines the generalization of all characteristics (i.e. a grouping of individual properties), that may be assigned to objects. Currently, subtypes of _IfcPropertyDefinition_ include property set occurrences, property set templates, and property templates.

* **Property set template** - _IfcPropertySetTemplate_, a collection of property templates that determine the definition of properties used within a project context.
* **Property template** - _IfcPropertyTemplate_, a single template that determines the definition of a particular property used in the same project context. The template may determine the name, description, data type, the unit, or a standard expression for each property that is based on that template.
* **Property set occurrence** - _IfcPropertySet_, a set of individual properties (that may or may not be determined by a property template) holding individual values, measure types and units, and are associated to an object occurrence or object type.

> NOTE  The subtype hierarchy of _IfcPropertyDefinition_ also includes statically defined property sets as _IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_. Those are rarely used collections of fixed attributes combined in an entity definition. The _IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_ can not be determined by an _IfcPropertySetTemplate_.

> NOTE  Individual properties, (subtypes of _IfcProperty_), are currently not included in the subtype hierarchy of _IfcPropertyDefinition_. This anomaly is due to upward compatibility reasons with earlier releases of this standard.

Property definitions define information that is shared among multiple instances of objects, either object occurrences or object types. _IfcPropertyDefinition_'s (by their instantiable subtypes) can participate within the following relationships:

* **Assignment to a project context** - an _HasContext_ relationship to _IfcRelDeclares_ that establishes the project context in which this property definition is declared. This relationship is predominately applicable to subtypes of _IfcPropertyTemplateDefinition_.
* **Association to external resources** - an _HasAssociation_ relationship to _IfcRelAssociates_ that refers to external sources of information (most notably a classification or document) and creates a uni-directional association. There is no dependency implied by the association.

Subtypes are included in more specific relationships, see _IfcPropertySetDefinition_ and _IfcPropertyTemplateDefinition_ for details.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0

## Attributes

### HasContext
Reference to the relationship _IfcRelDeclares_ and thus to the _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_.

### HasAssociations
Reference to the relationship _IfcRelAssociates_ and thus to those externally defined concepts, like classifications, documents, or library information, which are associated to the property definition.
