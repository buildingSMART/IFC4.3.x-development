# IfcPropertyTemplate

The _IfcPropertyTemplate_ is an abstract supertype comprising the templates for all dynamically extensible properties, either as an _IfcComplexPropertyTemplate_, or an _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_. These templates determine the structure of:

* in case of _IfcComplexPropertyTemplate_
  * an _IfcComplexProperty_
  * an _IfcPhysicalComplexQuantity_
* in case of _IfcSimplePropertyTemplate_
  * a subtype of _IfcSimpleProperty_
  * a subtype of _IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity_
<!-- end of short definition -->

The individual property templates are interpreted according to their _Name_ attribute and may have a predefined property type, property unit, and property data type. A template however shall not have measure values, or quantity values assigned.

> NOTE Property templates can form part of a property library used and attached as part of a project library. In general the _IfcPropertySetTemplate_, containing the subtypes of _IfcPropertyTemplate_ would be directly linked to the _IfcProjectLibrary_.
