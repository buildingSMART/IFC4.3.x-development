# IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor

The objectified relationship _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ is a specialization of the general grouping mechanism. It allows to add a factor to define the ratio that applies to the assignment of object definitions (individual object occurrences as subtypes of _IfcObject_ and object types as subtypes of _IfcTypeObject_) to a group (subtypes of _IfcGroup_).
<!-- end of short definition -->

The ratio can be used to define a percentage assignment. For example, a _Factor_ of 0.8 would indicate that the object is assigned by 80% to the group, or a _Factor_ of 2.5 would indicate the object is assigned with a weight factor of 2.5 to the group.

> NOTE Examples of factored groups include the assignment of load cases in a load combination in structural analysis, or the assignment of spaces by percentage to different rental zones.

The same object or object type may be included with the same or different _Factor_ values to many groups. Grouping relationships are not hierarchical.
