> EXAMPLE  Several instances of windows within the IFC project model may be of the same (catalogue or manufacturer) type. Thereby they share the same properties. This relationship is established by the subtype _IfcRelDefinesByType_ of the _IfcRelDefines_ relationship assigning an _IfcWindowType_ to multiple occurrences of _IfcWindow_.

> EXAMPLE  The (same) property set, e.g.  Pset_ProductManufacturerInfo, keeping the manufacturer name, label and production year of a product, can be assigned to one or many instances of furnishing. This relationship is established by the subtype _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ of _IfcRelDefines_ relationship assigning an _IfcPropertySet_ to one or more instances of _IfcFurnishingElement_.
