# IfcTypeProcess

_IfcTypeProcess_ defines a specific (or type) definition of a process or activity without being assigned to a schedule or a time.Â It is used to define a process or activity specification, that is, the specific process or activity information that is common to all occurrences that are defined for that process or activity type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An _IfcTypeProcess_ may have a list of property sets attached. Values of these properties are common to all occurrences of that process or activity type. The type occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_.

Subtypes of _IfcTypeProcess_ may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of _IfcProcess_.

## Attributes

### Identification
An identifying designation given to a process type.

### LongDescription
A long description, or text, describing the activity in detail.
> NOTE The inherited _SELF\IfcRoot.Description_ attribute is used as the short description.

### ProcessType
The type denotes a particular type that indicates the process further. The use has to be established at the level of instantiable subtypes. In particular it holds the user defined type, if the enumeration of the attribute _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### OperatesOn
Set of relationships to other objects, e.g. products, processes, controls, resources or actors that are operated on by the process type.
