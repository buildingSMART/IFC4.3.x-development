# IfcDistributionElement

_IfcDistributionElement_ is a generalization of all elements that participate in a distribution system. Typical examples of _IfcDistributionElement_ entities are (among others):

* building service elements within a heating system
* building service elements within a cooling system
* building service elements within a ventilation system
* building service elements within a plumbing system
* building service elements within a drainage system
* electrical elements
* building service elements within a communication network
* building service elements within a sensor (monitoring) network

The _IfcDistributionElement_ is further specialized in the IFC specification. Direct instantiation of _IfcDistributionElement_ without an assigned subtype of _IfcDistributionElementType_ provides the meaning of a distribution element proxy.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.5.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The entity is marked as deprecated for instantiation - will be made ABSTRACT in future releases.

## Attributes

### HasPorts
Reference to the element to port connection relationship. The relationship then refers to the port which is contained in this element.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  The inverse attribute is deprecated. Relationship to ports, contained within the _IfcDistributionElement_ is now realized by the inverse relationship _NestedBy_ referencing _IfcRelNests_.

## Concepts

### Component to Distribution System



### Object Typing

The _IfcDistributionElement_ defines the occurrence of any HVAC, electrical, sanitary or other element within a distribution system. Common information about distribution element types (or styles) is handled by subtypes of _IfcDistributionElementType_. The _IfcDistributionElementType_ (if present) may establish the common type name, usage (or predefined) type, common material, common set of properties and common shape representations (using _IfcRepresentationMap_). The _IfcDistributionElementType_ is attached using the _IfcRelDefinesByType.RelatingType_ objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ attribute.

The assignment of types to distribution element occurrences is vital for providing the additional meaning, or ontology, of the distribution element. Many specialized type are defined in other schemas of this specification.

### Property Sets for Objects



### Spatial Containment

The _IfcDistributionElement_ may be contained within the spatial containment tree. The _IfcSpace_ is the default spatial container.

> NOTE  The 'Spatial Containment' concept is mandatory in many model view definitions.

#### IfcBuildingStorey

The container for distribution elements spanning through two or more spaces.
