# IfcElement

An element is a generalization of all components that make up an AEC product.

Elements are physically existent objects, although they might be void elements, such as holes. Elements either remain permanently in the AEC product, or only temporarily, as formwork does. Elements can be either assembled on site or pre-manufactured and built in on site.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples of elements in a building construction context are walls, floors, windows and recesses.

The elements can be logically contained by a spatial structure element that constitutes a certain level within a project structure hierarchy (site, building, storey or space). This is done by using the _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship. An element can have material and quantity information assigned through the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ and _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship.

In addition an element can be declared to be a specific occurrence of an element type (and thereby be defined by the element type properties) using the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship. An element can also be defined as an element assembly that is a group of semantically and topologically related elements that form a higher level part of the AEC product. Those element assemblies are defined by virtue of the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Examples for element assembly are complete Roof Structures, made by several Roof Areas, or a Stair, composed by Flights and Landings.

Elements that performs the same function may be grouped by an "Element Group By Function". It is realized by an instance of _IfcGroup_ with the _ObjectType_ ='ElementGroupByFunction'.

## Attributes

### Tag
The tag (or label) identifier at the particular instance of a product, e.g. the serial number, or the position number. It is the identifier at the occurrence level.

### FillsVoids
Reference to the _IfcRelFillsElement_ Relationship that puts the element as a filling into the opening created within another element.

### ConnectedTo
Reference to the element connection relationship. The relationship then refers to the other element to which this element is connected to.

### IsInterferedByElements
Reference to the interference relationship to indicate the element that is interfered. The relationship, if provided, indicates that this element has an interference with one or many other elements.
> NOTE&nbsp; There is no indication of precedence between _IsInterferedByElements_ and _InterferesElements_.

> IFC4 CHANGE New inverse relationship.

### InterferesElements
Reference to the interference relationship to indicate the element that interferes. The relationship, if provided, indicates that this element has an interference with one or many other elements.
> NOTE&nbsp; There is no indication of precedence between _IsInterferedByElements_ and _InterferesElements_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE New inverse relationship.

### HasProjections
Projection relationship that adds a feature (using a Boolean union) to the _IfcBuildingElement_.

### HasOpenings
Reference to the _IfcRelVoidsElement_ relationship that creates an opening in an element. An element can incorporate zero-to-many openings. For each opening, that voids the element, a new relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ is generated.

### IsConnectionRealization
Reference to the connection relationship with realizing element. The relationship, if provided, assigns this element as the realizing element to the connection, which provides the physical manifestation of the connection relationship.

### ProvidesBoundaries
Reference to space boundaries by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelSpaceBoundary_. It defines the concept of an element bounding spaces.

### ConnectedFrom
Reference to the element connection relationship. The relationship then refers to the other element that is connected to this element.

### ContainedInStructure
Containment relationship to the spatial structure element, to which the element is primarily associated. This containment relationship has to be hierarchical, i.e. an element may only be assigned directly to zero or one spatial structure.

### HasCoverings
Reference to _IfcCovering_ by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelCoversBldgElement_. It defines the concept of an element having coverings associated.

### HasSurfaceFeatures
Reference to the _IfcRelAdheresToElement_ relationship that adheres a _IfcSurfaceFeature_ to an element. An element can incorporate zero-to-many surface features in one relationship.

## Concepts

### Body AdvancedBrep Geometry

An IfcElement (so far no further constraints are
 defined at the level of its subtypes or by view definitions) may be 
represented as a single or multiple boundary representation models, which include advanced surfaces, usually referred to 
as NURBS surfaces. The 'AdvancedBrep' representation allows for the 
representation of complex free-form element shape.



> NOTE  View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict or disallow the use of 'AdvancedBrep' geometry.


### Body Brep Geometry

Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are
 defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a
 single or multiple Boundary Representation models (which are 
restricted to be faceted Brep's with or without voids). The Brep 
representation allows for the representation of complex element 
shape.

> EXAMPLE  As shown in Figure 150, the Brep representation is given by an
>  IfcShapeRepresentation, which includes one or more 
> items, all of type IfcFacetedBrep. In some cases it may be useful to also expose a simple 
> representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex 
> shape.

representation



 


### Body CSG Geometry

Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are
 defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented a CSG primitive or CSG tree. The CSG 
representation allows for the representation of complex element 
shape.



> NOTE  View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict or disallow the use of 'CSG' geometry.


### Body SurfaceModel Geometry

Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are
 defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a
 single or multiple surface models, based on either shell or face 
based surface models. It may also include tessellated models.

> EXAMPLE  As shown in Figure 149, the surface model representation is given 
> by an IfcShapeRepresentation, which includes a single item which is either an IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel, or an IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel. In some cases it may also be useful to expose a simple 
> representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex 
> shape.

representation



 


### Body SurfaceOrSolidModel Geometry

Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are 
defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a mixed representation, including surface and solid models.


### Body Tessellation Geometry

Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are 
defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a 
single or multiple tessellated surface models, in particular 
triangulated surface models.


### Box Geometry


![bounding box](../../../../figures/ifcbuildingelement-boundingbox-layout1.gif)

> EXAMPLE  Any IfcElement may be represented by a bounding box, which shows the maximum extend of the body within the object coordinate system established by the IfcObjectPlacement. As shown in Figure 148, the bounding box representation is given by an IfcShapeRepresentation that includes a single item, an IfcBoundingBox.

### CoG Geometry

The 'CoG', Center of Gravity, shape representation is used as a means to verify the correct import by comparing the CoG of the imported geometry with the explicily provided CoG created during export.


### Element Projecting


### Element Voiding


### FootPrint Geometry


### Mapped Geometry




Any IfcElement (so far no further constraints are
 defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented using the
'MappedRepresentation'. This shall be supported as it allows for
 reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the
 same type. The results are more compact data sets.


The same constraints, as given for 'SurfaceOrSolidModel', 'SurfaceModel', 'Tessellation', 'Brep', and
 'AdvancedBrep' geometric representation, shall apply to the
 IfcRepresentationMap.



### Product Local Placement

The object placement for any subtype of IfcElement is defined
 by the
 IfcObjectPlacement, either IfcLocalPlacement or IfcGridPlacement, which defines the local
 object coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric
 representations of that IfcElement.
