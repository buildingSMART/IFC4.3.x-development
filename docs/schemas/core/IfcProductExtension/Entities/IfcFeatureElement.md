# IfcFeatureElement

A feature element is a generalization of all existence dependent elements which modify the shape and appearance of the associated master element. The _IfcFeatureElement_ offers the ability to handle shape modifiers as semantic objects within the IFC object model.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The term "feature" has a predefined meaning in a context of "feature-based modeling" and within steel construction work. It is introduced here in a broader sense to cover all existence dependent, but semantically described, modifiers of an element's shape and appearance. It is envisioned that future releases enhance the feature-based capabilities of the IFC model.

In contrary to the aggregation, as used in _IfcElementAssembly_, that defines the aggregate as a container element, that has equally treated parts, the feature concept introduced by _IfcFeatureElement_ defines the master element with subordinate parts as additions, or with voids or cut-outs as subtractions.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x2}
> IFC2x2 CHANGE The entity is introduced as an upward compatible extension of the IFC2x platform. It is an intermediate abstract supertype without defining its own explicit attributes.

## Formal Propositions

### NotContained
Element is not contained in spatial structure.

## Concepts

### Spatial Containment

As a subordinate part being fully dependent on the master element the IfcFeatureElement shall have no independent containment relationship to the spatial structure.

* The _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_ relationship shall be NIL.
