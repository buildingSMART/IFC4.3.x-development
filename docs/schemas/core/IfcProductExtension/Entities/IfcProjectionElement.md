# IfcProjectionElement

The projection element is a specialization of the general feature element to represent projections applied to building elements. It represents a solid attached to any element that has physical manifestation.

> EXAMPLE  A wall projection such as a pilaster strip is handled by _IfcProjectionElement_

> NOTE  View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict the types of elements to which _IfcProjectionElement_ can be applied.

An _IfcProjectionElement_ has to be linked to an element (all subtypes of _IfcElement_) by using the _IfcRelProjectsElement_ relationship. Its existence depends on the existence of the master element. The relationship implies a Boolean union operation between the volume of the projection element and the volume of the element.

The _IfcProjectionElement_ shall not participate in the containment relationship, i.e. it is not linked directly to the spatial structure of the project. It has a mandatory _ProjectsElements_ inverse relationship pointing to the _IfcElement_ that is contained in the spatial structure.

* The inverse relationship _ContainedInStructure_ shall be NIL.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic type for a projection element that is specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given specifically for the predefined types.
{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been added at the end of the entity definition.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either _PredefinedType_ is unset or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to _USERDEFINED_ or _PredefinedType_.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The geometric representation of _IfcProjectionElement_ can be defined using the swept area solid geometry. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_: 'SweptSolid'

The following constraints are recommended:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.Items_ may include a single, or multiple, instances of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_.
* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.SweptArea_ shall support _IfcRectangleProfileDef_, _IfcCircleProfileDef_ and _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_.
* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ shall extrude the profile in a direction non-parallel to the element it is projecting. This may be horizontal for wall projections or vertically for floor projections.
* If multiple instances of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ are used, the extrusion direction of each extrusion should be equal.

As shown in Figure PROJECTIONREP, the following interpretation of dimension parameters applies for rectangular projection:

* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim_ interpreted as projection width
* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim_ interpreted as projection height
* _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth_ is interpreted as projection depth

> NOTE  Rectangles are now defined centric, the placement location has to be set: IfcCartesianPoint(XDim/2,YDim/2)

> NOTE  The local placement directions for the _IfcProjectionElement_ are only given as an example, other directions are valid as well.

Figure PROJECTIONREP &mdash; Projection representation

The general geometric representation of _IfcProjectionElement_ can also be defined using the Brep or Tesselation geometry. The Brep or Tessellation representation allows for the representation of complex element shapes. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_: 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_: 'Tessellation' or 'Brep'

### Product Local Placement

The local placement for _IfcProjectionElement_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ should point to the local placement of the same element, to which the projection adds, i.e. referred to by _ProjectsElement.RelatingBuildingElement_.
