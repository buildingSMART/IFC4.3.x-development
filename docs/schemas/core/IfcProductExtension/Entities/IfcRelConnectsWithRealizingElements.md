# IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements

_IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ defines a generic relationship that is made between two elements that require the realization of that relationship by means of further realizing elements.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An _IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ is a specialization of _IfcRelConnectsElements_ where the connecting operation has the additional attribute of (one or many) realizing elements that may be used to realize or further qualify the relationship. It is defined as a ternary relationship.

> EXAMPLE It may be used to describe the attachment of one element to another where the attachment is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It may also be used to describe the mounting of one element onto another such as the requirement for the mounting major plant items onto builders work bases and/or anti-vibration isolators.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

> NOTE Regarding bridge prestressing, the tendon conduits and the tendon anchors are aggregated into the concrete elements, but not always the tendon itself (as the tendon may pass through several elements). Therefore, it is good practise to use RelConnects relationships between the tendon and the tendon conduits and the tendon anchors.

The connection types for bridges include:

* TrussJoint: Joint between truss members.
* ExpansionJoint: Joint allowing movement, usually due to thermal expansion difference in structures, with DiscreteAccessory of type EXPANSION_JOINT_DEVICE as RealizingElement.
* EmbeddedPartsJoint: Joint for auxiliary parts to structure, with appropriate RealizingElements, such as DiscreteAccessories of type ANCHORPLATE, BRACKET or SHOE.
* ConstructionJoint: Joint for phasing of construction, typically in in-situ concrete structures.

## Attributes

### RealizingElements
Defines the elements that realize a connection relationship.

### ConnectionType
The type of the connection given for informal purposes, it may include labels, like 'joint', 'rigid joint', 'flexible joint', etc.
