# IfcRelFillsElement

_IfcRelFillsElement_ is an objectified relationship between an opening element and an element that fills (or partially fills) the opening element. It is an one-to-one relationship.
<!-- end of short definition -->


> NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict an opening to be filled by one filling element only.

As shown in Figure 1, the insertion of a door into a wall is represented by two separate relationships. First the door opening is created within the wall by _IfcWall_ <-- _IfcRelVoidsElement_ --> _IfcOpeningElement_, then the door is inserted within the opening by _IfcOpeningElement_ <-- _IfcRelFillsElement_ --> _IfcDoor_. The red mark in the figure indicates that there shall be no _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ relationship that connects the opening to the spatial container of the wall.
