# IfcRelServicesBuildings

The _IfcRelServicesBuildings_ is an objectified relationship that defines the relationship between a system and the sites, buildings, storeys, spaces, or spatial zones, it serves. Examples of systems are:

* building service systems (heating, cooling, waste water system) represented by instances of _IfcDistributionSystem_;
* building systems (fenestration, shading) represented by instances of _IfcBuildingSystem_;
* zones as collection of logically grouped spaces represented by instances of _IfcZone_
* idealized structural analysis systems represented by instances of _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.
