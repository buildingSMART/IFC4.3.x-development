# IfcRelVoidsElement

_IfcRelVoidsElement_ is an objectified relationship between a building element and one opening element that creates a void in the element. It is a one-to-one relationship. This relationship implies a boolean operation of subtraction between the geometric bodies of the element and the opening.
<!-- end of short definition -->

As shown in Figure 1, the insertion of a void into a wall is represented by the relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_. The opening within the wall is defined by the pattern _IfcWall_ - _IfcRelVoidsElement_ - _IfcOpeningElement_.
