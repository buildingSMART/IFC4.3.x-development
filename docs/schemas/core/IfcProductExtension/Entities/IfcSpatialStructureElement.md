# IfcSpatialStructureElement

A spatial structure element is the generalization of all spatial elements that might be used to define a spatial structure. The spatial structure can be used to provide a spatial organization of a project.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A spatial project structure might define as many levels of decomposition as necessary for the project. Elements within the spatial project structure are:

* site as _IfcSite_
* facility as _IfcFacility_, or specifically
  * building as _IfcBuilding_
  * bridge as _IfcBridge_
  * marine facility as _IfcMarineFacility_
  * railway as _IfcRailway_
  * road as _IfcRoad_

* facility part as _IfcFacilityPart_, or specifically
  * storey as _IfcBuildingStorey_
  * facility part as _IfcFacilityPart_

* space as _IfcSpace_

or aggregations or parts thereof. The composition type declares an element to be either an element itself, or an aggregation (complex) or a decomposition (part). The interpretation of these types is given at each subtype of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_.

The _IfcRelAggregates_ is defined as an 1-to-many relationship and used to establish the relationship between exactly two levels within the spatial project structure. Finally the highest level of the spatial structure is assigned to _IfcProject_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_.

The subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ relate to other elements and systems by establishing the following relationships:

* **Containment of elements** : _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_ by inverse attribute _ContainsElements_, used to assign any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. to the spatial structure element in which they are primarily contained.
* **Reference of elements** : _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ by inverse attribute _ReferencesElements_, used to reference any element, like building elements, MEP elements, etc. in spatial structure elements, other then the one, where it is contained. Since the deprecation of _IfcRelServicesBuildings_, _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_ is also used to reference a system, like a building service or electrical distribution system, a zonal system, or a structural analysis system, that is assigned to this spatial structure element.

The subtypes of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ relate to each other by using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship to build the project spatial structure. Figure 1 shows the use of _IfcRelAggregates_ to establish a spatial structure including site, building, building section and storey. More information is provided at the level of the subtypes.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The spatial project structure, established by the _IfcRelAggregates_, shall be acyclic.
2. A site should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a building, storey or space.
3. A building should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a storey or space.
4. A storey should not be (directly or indirectly) associated to a space.

## Attributes

### CompositionType
Denotes, whether the predefined spatial structure element represents itself, or an aggregate (complex) or a part (part). The interpretation is given separately for each subtype of spatial structure element. If no _CompositionType_ is asserted, the default value ''ELEMENT'' applies.

> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional.

## Formal Propositions

### WR41
All spatial structure elements shall be associated (using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship) with another spatial structure element, or with IfcProject.
