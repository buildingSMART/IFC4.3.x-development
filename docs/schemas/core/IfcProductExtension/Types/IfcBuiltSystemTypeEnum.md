# IfcBuiltSystemTypeEnum

This enumeration identifies different types of built systems.<!-- end of definition -->

## Items

### REINFORCING
System of elements providing reinforcing to the structure.

### MOORING
System of components and elements responsible for keeping or holding an element (a vessel, platform or set of catenary lines) in a desired position.

### OUTERSHELL
System of built elements that provide the outer skin to protect the construction (such as the facade).

### TRACKCIRCUIT
A track circuit is an electric circuit of which the rails of a track section form a part, with usually a source of current connected at one end and a detection device at the other end for detecting whether this track section is clear or occupied by a vehicle. In a continuous signalling system, the track circuit can be used to transmit information between the ground and the train.
Note: definition from IEC 60050-82.

### EROSIONPREVENTION
A grouping of elements into a built system for preventing unwanted relocation of material particles in earthworks slopes or rock faces.
Typical types of erosion prevention include:

* Planting
* Solid
* Framework
* Anchored framework
* Shotcrete
* Screening
* Geosynthetics (geotextiles)

### FOUNDATION
System of shallow and deep foundation elements that transmit forces to the supporting ground.

### LOADBEARING
System of built elements that transmit forces and stiffen the construction.

### SHADING
System of shading elements (external or internal) that permits the limitation or control of impact of natural sun light.

### FENESTRATION
System of doors, windows, and other fillings in openings in a built envelope that are designed to permit the passage of air or light.

### TRANSPORT
System of all transport elements in a facility that enable the transport of people or goods.

### PRESTRESSING
System of elements providing pre-stressing to the structure, including typically manufactured products such as tendons, anchorages (active, dead, coupling), ducts, vents and deviators, and in-situ concrete segments, tendon spacers, blisters and additional reinforcements.

### RAILWAYLINE

A set of functional tracks with explicit terminals. It is usually composed of a set of tracks with continuous track parts and alignments.

### RAILWAYTRACK

Railway track system. It is usually composed of continuous sequences of track parts and alignments.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
