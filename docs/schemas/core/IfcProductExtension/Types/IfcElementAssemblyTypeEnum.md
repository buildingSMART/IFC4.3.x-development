# IfcElementAssemblyTypeEnum

This enumeration defines the basic configuration types for element assemblies.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New enumeration in IFC2x2.

## Items

### ACCESSORY_ASSEMBLY
Assembled accessories or components.

### ARCH


### BEAM


### BRACED_FRAME
A rigid frame with additional bracing members.

### GIRDER
A beam-like superstructure, such as bridge main girder extending between abutments and piers built up of beams, braces (as Members) etc. - may also be an aggregation of girder segments.

### REINFORCEMENT_UNIT
Assembled reinforcement elements.

### RIGID_FRAME
A structure built up of beams, columns, etc. with moment-resisting joints, such as gantry

### SLAB


### TRUSS
A structure built up of members with (quasi) pinned joint.

### ABUTMENT
A bridge abutment built up of walls, beams, slabs etc.

### PIER
An intermediate support e.g. in a bridge, built up of walls, columns, beams etc.

### PYLON
A vertical structure supporting cables in suspended or stayed structure.

### CROSS_BRACING
A Structural linear member or assembly of memebrs inside a box girder or between girders, typically on a pier, to resist lateral forces and transfer them to the support.

### DECK
A platform (such as floor or bridge deck) built up of beams, slabs.

### MAST
An assembly of plates, members, cables or fasteners that form a vertical structure for the support or mounting of other equipment such as lights, sonar or wireless transmitters.

### SIGNALASSEMBLY
An assembly to physically aggregate together one or more signal instances (and also sign instances) including any supporting structural elements such as a simple pole or a rigid frame gantry.

### GRID
A framework of spaced cables or bars that are parallel to or cross each other.

### SHELTER


### SUPPORTINGASSEMBLY


### SUSPENSIONASSEMBLY
A complex assembly of components used to suspend elements or cable segments.

### TRACTION_SWITCHING_ASSEMBLY
A common assembly used to insure the switching function. It is composed of switches, control instruments and other components.

### TRACKPANEL
Trackwork ensuring the support and guidance of a vehicle along a route. It consists of assembly of rail, sleepers and fastenings.

### TURNOUTPANEL
Trackwork ensuring the support and guidance of a vehicle along any given route among various diverging or intersecting tracks.
Note: definition from NF EN 13232-1-2004.

### DILATATIONPANEL


### RAIL_MECHANICAL_EQUIPMENT_ASSEMBLY
A complex assembly made up of several components like blocking device, speed regulator, bias loaded inspector, track scale or controllable retarder.

### ENTRANCEWORKS
An assembly forming the support structure of a chamber (lock, dock) gate and associated elements, plus the containment of operational equipment.

### SUMPBUSTER
An obstacle (with oil catchment basin) installed typically in a bus lane to prevent other traffic with lower ground clearance from using it. Also Sump breaker or Sump trap.

### TRAFFIC_CALMING_DEVICE
A structure on the carriageway to control the speed of vehicles.

NOTE Definition from ISO 6707-1: Encouragement of restrained and considerate behaviour by means such as road humps and reductions in width of the travelled way (US:traffic restraint, UK:speed bump).
NOTE Definition from PIARC: Local carriageway layout (staggered section, choker) or physical device (central island, round- or flat-top road hump, speed bump, rumble strips, etc.) to control the speed of road vehicles.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined element assembly.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined element assembly.
