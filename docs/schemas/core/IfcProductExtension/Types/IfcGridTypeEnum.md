# IfcGridTypeEnum

This enumeration defines the different layout types of grids. Restriction on the correct use of _IfcGrid_ instantiations may be imposed depending on the value of the _PredefinedType_ being _IfcGridTypeEnum_.<!-- end of definition -->

> HISTORY New enumeration in IFC4.

> NOTE View definitions or implementer agreements may impose further restrictions on how to populate the grid axes. The first grid axis being part of u-axes may have to be parallel to the x-axis of the grid object placement.

## Items

### RECTANGULAR
An _IfcGrid_ with straight u-axes and straight v-axes being perpendicular to each other. All grid axes being part of u-axes can be described by one axis line and all other axes being 2D offsets from this axis line. The same applies to all grid axes being part of V-axes.

### RADIAL
An _IfcGrid_ with straight u-axes and curved v-axes. All grid axes being part of V-axes have the same center point and are concentric circular arcs. All grid axes being part of u-axes intersect at the same center point and rotate counter clockwise.

### TRIANGULAR
An _IfcGrid_ with u-axes, v-axes, and w-axes all being co-linear axis lines with a 2D offset. The v-axes are at 60 degree rotated counter clockwise from the u-axes, and the w-axes are at 120 degree rotated counter clockwise from the u-axes.

### IRREGULAR
An _IfcGrid_ with u-axes, v-axes, and optionally w-axes that cannot be described by the patterns.

### USERDEFINED
Any other grid not conforming to any of the above restrictions.

### NOTDEFINED
Not known whether grid conforms to any standard type.
