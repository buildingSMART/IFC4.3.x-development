# IfcWindowPanelOperationEnum

This enumeration defines the basic ways to describe how window panels operate, as shown in Figure 2.

The opening direction of the window panels is given by the local placement of the _IfcWindow_. The positive y-axis determines the direction as shown in Figure 2.

Note:

1. Figures are shown as viewed from the outside (in direction of the positive y-axis).
2. Figures (symbolic representation) depend on the national building code
3. These figures/ are only shown as illustrations
