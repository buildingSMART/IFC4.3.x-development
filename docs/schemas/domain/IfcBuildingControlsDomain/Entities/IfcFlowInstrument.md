# IfcFlowInstrument

A flow instrument reads and displays the value of a particular property of a system at a point, or displays the difference in the value of a property between two points.

Instrumentation is typically for the purpose of determining the value of the property at a point in time. It is not the purpose of an instrument to record or integrate the values over time (although they may be connected to recording devices that do perform such a function). This entity provides for all forms of mechanical flow instrument (thermometers, pressure gauges etc.) and electrical flow instruments (ammeters, voltmeters etc.)

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## WhereRules

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcFlowInstrumentType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no flow instrument type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcFlowInstrumentType_.
