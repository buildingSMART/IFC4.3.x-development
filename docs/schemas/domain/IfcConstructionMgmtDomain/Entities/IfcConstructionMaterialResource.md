# IfcConstructionMaterialResource

_IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ identifies a material resource type in a construction project.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2.0.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute _Suppliers_ has been deleted; use _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ to assign an _IfcActor_ to fulfill the role as a supplier. The attribute _UsageRatio_ has been deleted; use _BaseQuantityConsumed_ and _BaseQuantityProduced_ to indicate material usage.

Occurrences of _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ are consumed (wholly or partially), or occupied during a construction work task (_IfcTask_).

Similar to _IfcConstructionProductResource_, sometimes things such as 5000kg of gravel are already instantiated as an instance of an _IfcProduct_ subtype because it is a result of a work task (for example, ‘transporting gravel’). In this case, the instance of _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ can be associated with the product instance ‘5000kg of gravel’ to provide more information for resource uses. Nevertheless, _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ should only be used to represent resource usage, but not product substances.

> NOTE This entity is not the same as _IfcMaterial_. On the one hand, _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ represents usage of bulk materials such as sand, gravels, nails and so on. Physical manifestations can be instantiated from _IfcProduct_ as well, depending on their uses in the system, and such an _IfcProduct_ object can be assigned to the _IfcConstructionMaterialResource_ object via _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. On the other hand, _IfcMaterial_ is about physical materials that a physical building element consists of, possibly with detailed material layering information."
