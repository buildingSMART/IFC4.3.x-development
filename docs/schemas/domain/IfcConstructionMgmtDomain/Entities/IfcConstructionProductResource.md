Occurrences of _IfcConstructionProductResource_ are usage of products to assist the process of construction. More specifically, they are usage of products that result from some construction processes and that are then used as resources to facilitate further construction.

However, they are used as resources in the process ‘pouring concrete’ in a later stage of the project.
