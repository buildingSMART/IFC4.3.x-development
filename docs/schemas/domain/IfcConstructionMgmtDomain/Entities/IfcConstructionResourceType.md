# IfcConstructionResourceType

_IfcConstructionResourceType_ is an abstract generalization of the different resource types used in construction projects, mainly labor, material, equipment and product resource types, plus subcontracted resource types and aggregations such as a crew resource type.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A resource type represents a model of "use of something" and does not necessarily correspond to a specific type of object such as a person or vehicle, but represents possible usages of such objects such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource type can either represent usage in general (consumption attributes defined but no task type assignment) or a task-specific resource type (production attributes defined and having an _IfcTask_ assignment).

A construction resource type captures common productivities and cost rates for applying resources to particular task types.

Composition use definition

Resource types may be decomposed into nested resource types indicating productivities when applying the resource to specific task types using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship where _IfcRelNests.RelatingObject_ refers to the general resource type and _IfcRelNests.RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more task-specific productivities. For example, an _IfcLaborResourceType_ may be defined for "Carpenter" which may have a nested _IfcLaborResourceType_ for "Carpenter - Wall Framing" and another nested _IfcLaborResourceType_ for "Carpenter - Drywall", each of which may have productivities based according to specific task types (_IfcTaskType_).

Assignment use definition

Resource types may be assigned to process types (_IfcTypeProcess_ subtypes) using the _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ relationship as shown in Figure 1. Such relationship indicates that the resource type applies to the process type for the use indicated (e.g. _IfcTaskType.PredefinedType_). Such relationship enables a scenario of placing an _IfcProduct_ of a particular _IfcTypeProduct_, querying for a set of _IfcTypeProcess_ process types for constructing such product (e.g. _IfcTaskTypeEnum.CONSTRUCTION_), querying each _IfcTypeProcess_ for a set of _IfcTypeResource_ resource types for carrying out the process, and finally choosing an _IfcTypeProcess_ and _IfcTypeResource_ combination resulting in the shortest time for instantiated _IfcTask_ occurrence(s) and/or lowest-cost for instantiated _IfcConstructionResource_ occurrence(s).

## Attributes

### BaseCosts
Indicates the unit costs and environmental impacts for which accrued amounts should be calculated. Such unit costs may be split into _Name_ designations (e.g. 'Standard', 'Overtime'), and may contain a hierarchy of cost values that apply at different dates (using _IfcCostValue.ApplicableDate_ and _IfcCostValue.FixedUntilDate_).

### BaseQuantity
Identifies the quantity for which the _BaseQuantityProduced_ applies. The _Name_ of the _IfcPhysicalQuantity_ identifies the quantity definition being measured, e.g. "GrossVolume". For production-based resources (e.g. carpentry labor), this value refers to quantities on _IfcProduct_(s) to which the assigned _IfcTask_ is assigned. For duration-based resources (e.g. safety inspector, fuel for equipment), this value refers to quantities that may be assigned to occurrences of the assigned _IfcTaskType_.
