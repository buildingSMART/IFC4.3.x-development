# IfcLaborResourceType

The resource type _IfcLaborResourceType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of labour resources. The set of shared information may include:

* common productivities
* common cost rates
* common properties within shared property sets
<!-- end of definition -->
It is used to define a labour resource specification (the specific resource information that is common to all occurrences of that resource). Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcLaborResourceType_ are represented by instances of _IfcLaborResource_.
