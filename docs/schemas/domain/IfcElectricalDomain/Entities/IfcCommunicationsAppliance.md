# IfcCommunicationsAppliance

A communications appliance transmits and receives electronic or digital information as data or sound.
<!-- end of short definition -->


Communication appliances may be fixed in place or may be able to be moved from one space to another. Communication appliances require an electrical supply that may be supplied either by an electrical circuit or provided from a local battery source.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcCommunicationsApplianceType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no communications appliance type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcCommunicationsApplianceType_.
