# IfcOutlet

An outlet is a device installed at a point to receive one or more inserted plugs for electrical power or communications.

Power outlets are commonly connected within a junction box; data outlets may be directly connected to a wall. For power outlets sharing the same circuit within a junction box, the ports should indicate the logical wiring relationship to the enclosing junction box, even though they may be physically connected to a cable going to another outlet, switch, or fixture.
