# IfcProtectiveDevice

A protective device breaks an electrical circuit when a stated electric current that passes through it is exceeded.
<!-- end of short definition -->

A protective device provides protection against electrical current only (not as a general protective device). It may be used to represent the complete set of elements including both the tripping unit and the breaking unit that provide the protection. This may be particularly useful at earlier stages of design where the approach to breaking the electrical supply may be determined but the method of tripping may not. Alternatively, this entity may be used to specifically represent the breaking unit alone (in which case the tripping unit will also be specifically identified). This entity is specific to dedicated protective devices and excludes electrical outlets that may have circuit protection.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcProtectiveDeviceType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no protective device type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcProtectiveDeviceType_.

## Concepts

### Material Set



#### Casing

Material from which the casing is constructed.

### Object Typing



### Port Nesting



#### SINK_Line_ELECTRICAL

The supply line, typically connected from a slot in a distribution board.

#### SOURCE_Load_ELECTRICAL

The load protected by this device, typically a cable connected to a device or the first junction box of a circuit.
