# Pset_CableSegmentTypeCableSegment

Electrical cable with a specific purpose to lead electric current within a circuit or any other electric construction. Includes all types of electric cables, mainly several electrical segments wrapped together, e.g. cable, tube, busbar. Note that the number of conductors within a cable is determined by an aggregation mechanism that aggregates the conductors within the cable. A single-core cable is defined in IEV 461-06-02 as being 'a cable having only one core'; a multiconductor cable is defined in IEV 461-06-03 as b eing 'a cable having more than one conductor, some of which may be uninsulated'; a mulicore cable is defined in IEV 461-06-04 as being 'a cable having more than one core'.
