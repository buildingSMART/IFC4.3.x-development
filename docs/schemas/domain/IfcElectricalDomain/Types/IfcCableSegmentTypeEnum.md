# IfcCableSegmentTypeEnum

The _IfcCableSegmentTypeEnum_ defines the range of different types of cable segment that can be specified.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New type in IFC2x2. Core and busbar segment added in IFC4.

## Items

### BUSBARSEGMENT
Electrical conductor that makes a common connection between several electrical circuits. Properties of a busbar are the same as those of a cable segment and are captured by the cable segment property set.

### CABLESEGMENT
Cable with a specific purpose to lead electric current within a circuit or any other electric construction. Includes all types of electric cables, mainly several core segments or conductor segments wrapped together.

### CONDUCTORSEGMENT
A single linear element within a cable or an exposed wire (such as for grounding) with the specific purpose to lead electric current, data, or a telecommunications signal.

### CORESEGMENT
A self contained element of a cable that comprises one or more conductors and sheathing.The core of one lead is normally single wired or multiwired which are intertwined.

### CONTACTWIRESEGMENT
An electric conductor of an overhead contact line with which the current collectors make contact.
Note: definition from IEC60050 811-33-15.

### FIBERSEGMENT
A fiber segment is an individual optical fiber used in telecommunication systems to transmit data by means of optical signals.

### FIBERTUBE
A fiber tube is semi-rigid hollow plastic tube with a very small radius that houses and protects a certain number of optical fiber segments. An optical cable segment may contain many fiber tubes.

### OPTICALCABLESEGMENT
An optical cable segment is a cable segment that contains a variable number of optical fiber segments.

### STITCHWIRE
A stitch wire consists of auxiliary wires and different components (clamp) used in stitched suspension.

### WIREPAIRSEGMENT
A pair of conductors contained in a copper cable. The pair is always used together to form a circuit to transmit data by means of electric signals.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
