The _IfcElectricFlowStorageDeviceTypeEnum_ defines different types of electrical flow storage devices.

<!-- end of short definition -->


> HISTORY New type in IFC2x2.

## Items

### BATTERY
A device for storing energy in chemical form so that it can be released as electrical energy.

### CAPACITORBANK
A device that stores electrical energy when an external power supply is present using the electrical property of capacitance.

### HARMONICFILTER
A device that constantly injects currents that precisely correspond to the harmonic components drawn by the load.

### INDUCTORBANK
A device that stores electrical energy in a magnetic field using electrical property of inductance.

### UPS
A device that provides a time limited alternative source of power supply in the event of failure of the main supply.

### CAPACITOR
A device that stores electric charge when an external power supply is present using the electrical property of capacitance. Two-terminal device characterized essentially by its capacitance.
Note: definition from IEC 60050 151-13-28.

### COMPENSATOR
A device that is used to fix or adjust the parameter of electric energy, such as voltage loss, power factor and so on.

### INDUCTOR
A device used in circuits or power systems due to their inductance, acting as a component of electric storage device.

### RECHARGER
A recharger or battery charger is a device used to put energy into a secondary cell or rechargeable battery by forcing an electric current through it.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
