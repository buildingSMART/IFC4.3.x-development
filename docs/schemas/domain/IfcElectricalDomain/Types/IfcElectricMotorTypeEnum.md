# IfcElectricMotorTypeEnum

The _IfcElectricMotorTypeEnum_ defines the range of different types of electric motor that can be specified.

## Items

### DC
A motor using either generated or rectified Direct Current (DC) power.

### INDUCTION
An alternating current motor in which the primary winding on one member (usually the stator) is connected to the power source and a secondary winding or a squirrel-cage secondary winding on the other member (usually the rotor) carries the induced current. There is no physical electrical connection to the secondary winding, its current is induced.

### POLYPHASE
A two or three-phase induction motor in which the windings, one for each phase, are evenly divided by the same number of electrical degrees.

### RELUCTANCESYNCHRONOUS
A synchronous motor with a special rotor design which directly lines the rotor up with the rotating magnetic field of the stator, allowing for no slip under load.

### SYNCHRONOUS
A motor that operates at a constant speed up to full load. The rotor speed is equal to the speed of the rotating magnetic field of the stator; there is no slip.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
