## Items

### E_UTRAN_NODE_B
An E-utran nodel B is a logical network component which serves one or more E-utran cells. It is the hardware connected to the evolved packet core (EPC), more specifically to the mobility management entity (MME) , which communicates directly with user equipment in wireless way.

### REMOTERADIOUNIT
A remote radio unit is a component of a distributed base transceiver station that converts digital baseband signals into high-frequency (rf) signals and sends high-frequency (rf) signals to the antenna for radiation.

### ACCESSPOINT
An access point is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

### BASETRANSCEIVERSTATION
A base transceiver station (BTS) is a network component which serves one cell. It completes the conversion between base station controller and wireless channel, and realizes the wireless transmission and related control functions between base station controller and mobile switching through the air interface.

### REMOTEUNIT
A remote unit is a device used to amplify a base station signal.

### BASEBANDUNIT
A baseband unit is a component of a distributed base transceiver station for implementing baseband processing functions.

### MASTERUNIT
A master unit is a component of a repeater for coupling base station signals.

### GATEWAY_GPRS_SUPPORT_NODE
The gateway GPRS support node is a component of the GPRS core network that extends the GSM to allow packet switching functionalities. This component is responsible for the internetworking between the GPRS network and external packet switched networks (e.g. the internet).

### SUBSCRIBERSERVER
It is a database in charge of the management of mobile subscribers. It can be an authentication center (AuC) or a home location register (HLR).

### MOBILESWITCHINGCENTER
The mobile switching centre (MSC) constitutes the interface between the radio system and the fixed networks. It is an exchange which performs all the switching and signalling functions for mobile station located in a geographical area designated as the MSC area. It consists of a MSC server and a media gateway.

### MSCSERVER
The MSC server mainly comprises the call control (CC) and mobility control parts of a mobile switching center (MSC). An MSC server and a media gateway make up the full functionality of an MSC.

### PACKETCONTROLUNIT
A packet control unit performs some of the processing tasks of the base station controller for packet data. It is responsible for data packet, wireless channel management, error sending detection and automatic retransmission.

### SERVICE_GPRS_SUPPORT_NODE
The service GPRS support node (SGSN) is a component of the GPRS core network. It is the GPRS support node of mobile station service, and it can achieve mobility management and packet routing and transfer.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
