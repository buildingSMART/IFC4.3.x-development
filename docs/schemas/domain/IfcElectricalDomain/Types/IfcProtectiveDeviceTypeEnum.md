# IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum

The _IfcProtectiveDeviceTypeEnum_ specifically defines the range of different breaker unit types that can be used in conjunction with protective device. Types may also be used as a reference to a complete protective device in circumstances where tripping units are not separately identified (typically expected to be the case during earlier stages of design).

## Items

### CIRCUITBREAKER
A mechanical switching device capable of making, carrying, and breaking currents under normal circuit conditions and also making, carrying for a specified time and breaking, current under specified abnormal circuit conditions such as those of short circuit.

### EARTHLEAKAGECIRCUITBREAKER
A device that opens, closes, or isolates a circuit and has short circuit protection but no overload protection. It attempts to break the circuit when there is a leakage of current from phase to earth, by measuring voltage on the earth conductor.

### EARTHINGSWITCH
A safety device used to open or close a circuit when there is no current. Used to isolate a part of a circuit, a machine, a part of an overhead line or an underground line so that maintenance can be safely conducted.

### FUSEDISCONNECTOR
A device that will electrically open the circuit after a period of prolonged, abnormal current flow.

### RESIDUALCURRENTCIRCUITBREAKER
A device that opens, closes, or isolates a circuit and has short circuit and overload protection. It attempts to break the circuit when there is a difference in current between any two phases. May also be referred to as 'Ground Fault Interupter (GFI)' or 'Ground Fault Circuit Interuptor (GFCI)'

### RESIDUALCURRENTSWITCH
A device that opens, closes or isolates a circuit and has no short circuit or overload protection. May also be identified as a 'ground fault switch'.

### VARISTOR
A high voltage surge protection device.

### ANTI_ARCING_DEVICE
An anti-arcing device is an equipment that prevents electric arc.

### SPARKGAP
A spark gap is a device used to connect a circuit to earth in the event of a fault in live circuits.

### VOLTAGELIMITER
a voltage limiter is an equipment that prevents the over voltage.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
