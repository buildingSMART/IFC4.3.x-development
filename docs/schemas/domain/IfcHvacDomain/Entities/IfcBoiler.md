A boiler is a closed, pressure-rated vessel in which water or other fluid is heated using an energy source such as natural gas, heating oil, or electricity. The fluid in the vessel is then circulated out of the boiler for use in various processes or heating applications.

<!-- end of short definition -->


_IfcBoiler_ is a vessel solely used for heating of water or other fluids. Storage vessels, such as for drinking water storage are considered as tanks and use the _IfcTank_ entity.
