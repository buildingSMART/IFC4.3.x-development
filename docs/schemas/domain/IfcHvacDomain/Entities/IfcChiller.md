# IfcChiller

A chiller is a device used to remove heat from a liquid via a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle to cool a fluid, typically water or a mixture of water and glycol. The chilled fluid is then used to cool and dehumidify air in a building.<!-- end of definition -->

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcChillerType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no chiller type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcChillerType_.
