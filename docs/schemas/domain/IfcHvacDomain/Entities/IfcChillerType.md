# IfcChillerType

The energy conversion device type **IfcChillerType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of chillers. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
* common ports
<!-- end of definition -->
It is used to define a chiller type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcChillerType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcChillerType** are represented by instances of _IfcChiller_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcChiller_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
