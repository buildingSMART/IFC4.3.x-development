# IfcCoil

A coil is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media. A common example is a cooling coil, which utilizes a finned coil in which circulates chilled water, antifreeze, or refrigerant that is used to remove heat from air moving across the surface of the coil. A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.<!-- end of definition -->

Coils may also be used for non-airflow cases such as embedded in a floor slab.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcCoilType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no coil type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcCoilType_.
