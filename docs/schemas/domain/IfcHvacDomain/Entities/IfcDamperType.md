# IfcDamperType

The flow controller type **IfcDamperType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of dampers. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
* common ports

It is used to define a damper type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcDamperType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcDamperType** are represented by instances of _IfcDamper_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcDamper_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
