It is used to define a engine type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcEngineType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcEngineType** are represented by instances of _IfcEngine_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcEngine_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
