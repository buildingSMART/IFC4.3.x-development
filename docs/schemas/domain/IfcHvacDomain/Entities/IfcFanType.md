# IfcFanType

The flow moving device type **IfcFanType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of fans. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
* common ports
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a fan type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcFanType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcFanType** are represented by instances of _IfcFan_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcFan_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
