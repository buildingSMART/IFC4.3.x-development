* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
* common ports


<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a flow meter type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcFlowMeterType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcFlowMeterType** are represented by instances of _IfcFlowMeter_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcFlowMeter_ for supported property sets, materials, composition, and ports.
