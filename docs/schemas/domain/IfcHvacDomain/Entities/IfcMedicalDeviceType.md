The flow terminal type **IfcMedicalDeviceType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of medical devices. The set of shared information may include:

It is used to define a medical device type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcMedicalDeviceType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcMedicalDeviceType** are represented by instances of _IfcMedicalDevice_.
