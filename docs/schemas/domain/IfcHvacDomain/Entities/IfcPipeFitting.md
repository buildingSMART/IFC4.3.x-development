# IfcPipeFitting

A pipe fitting is a junction or transition in a piping flow distribution system used to connect pipe segments, resulting in changes in flow characteristics to the fluid such as direction or flow rate.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcPipeFittingType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no pipe fitting type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcPipeFittingType_.
