## Attributes

### PredefinedType


## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcUnitaryEquipmentType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no unitary equipment type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcUnitaryEquipmentType_.

## Concepts

### Aggregation



#### IfcDistributionElement

Unitary equipment (air handlers in particular) may elaborate contained elements such as dampers, fans, coils, sensors, actuators, and controllers. Such breakdown provides access to component information and tracking of performance history for embedded elements.
