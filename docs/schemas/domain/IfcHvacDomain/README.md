IfcHvacDomain
=============

The _IfcHvacDomain_ schema defines basic object concepts required for interoperability within the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) domain. It extends concepts defined in the _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_ schema.

The scope of the _IfcHvacDomain_ schema is defined as:

1. The segments, fittings and connections that constitute duct and piping distribution systems typically used for building services, such as for air conditioning, ventilation and exhaust-air systems; chilled water, steam and heating hot water, potable water, waste, natural gas and LPG systems, etc.
2. Equipment typically used in building services systems, such as boilers, chillers, fans, and pumps and the vibration isolation associated with these components.
3. Terminal and flow control devices, such as air vents and grilles, variable air volume modulators, valves, and dampers.

The following are deemed to be out of scope of the _IfcHvacDomain_ schema at this time:

* Industrial and institutional specialty equipment such as that used for power production, manufacturing and fabrication, etc.
* Provisions for dealing explicitly with hazardous materials such as chemical or biological agents
* Controls systems and sequencing systems for these equipment beyond what is defined in the _IfcBuildingControlsDomain_ schema

> HISTORY  This schema has been significantly modified in IFC2x2.
