This enumeration defines the various types of damper

> HISTORY  New enumeration in IFC2.0.

## Items

### BACKDRAFTDAMPER
Damper used for purposes of manually balancing pressure differences.  Commonly operated by mechanical adjustment.

### BALANCINGDAMPER
Backdraft damper used to restrict the movement of air in one direction.  Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### BLASTDAMPER
Blast damper used to prevent protect occupants and equipment against overpressures resultant of an explosion.  Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### CONTROLDAMPER
Control damper used to modulate the flow of air by adjusting the position of the blades.  Commonly operated by an actuator of a building automation system.

### FIREDAMPER
Fire damper used to prevent the spread of fire for a specified duration.  Commonly operated by fusable link that melts above a certain temperature.

### FIRESMOKEDAMPER
Combination fire and smoke damper used to preven the spread of fire and smoke.  Commonly operated by a fusable link and a smoke detector.

### FUMEHOODEXHAUST
Fume hood exhaust damper.  Commonly operated by actuator.

### GRAVITYDAMPER
Gravity damper closes from the force of gravity.  Commonly operated by gravitational weight.

### GRAVITYRELIEFDAMPER
Gravity-relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of enough pressure to overcome the gravitational force exerted upon the damper blades.  Commonly operated by gravitational weight.

### RELIEFDAMPER
Relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of a specified pressure differential.  Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### SMOKEDAMPER
Smoke damper used to prevent the spread of smoke.  Commonly operated by a smoke detector of a building automation system.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined damper.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined damper.
