## Items

### BACKDRAFTDAMPER
Damper used for purposes of manually balancing pressure differences. Commonly operated by mechanical adjustment.

### BALANCINGDAMPER
Backdraft damper used to restrict the movement of air in one direction. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### BLASTDAMPER
Blast damper used to prevent protect occupants and equipment against overpressures resultant of an explosion. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### CONTROLDAMPER
Control damper used to modulate the flow of air by adjusting the position of the blades. Commonly operated by an actuator of a building automation system.

### FIREDAMPER
Fire damper used to prevent the spread of fire for a specified duration. Commonly operated by fusable link that melts above a certain temperature.

### FIRESMOKEDAMPER
Combination fire and smoke damper used to prevent the spread of fire and smoke. Commonly operated by a fusable link and a smoke detector.

### FUMEHOODEXHAUST
Fume hood exhaust damper. Commonly operated by actuator.

### GRAVITYDAMPER
Gravity damper closes from the force of gravity. Commonly operated by gravitational weight.

### GRAVITYRELIEFDAMPER
Gravity-relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of enough pressure to overcome the gravitational force exerted upon the damper blades. Commonly operated by gravitational weight.

### RELIEFDAMPER
Relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of a specified pressure differential. Commonly operated by mechanical spring.

### SMOKEDAMPER
Smoke damper used to prevent the spread of smoke. Commonly operated by a smoke detector of a building automation system.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined damper.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined damper.
