# IfcPipeFittingTypeEnum

This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a pipe fitting. This is a very basic categorization mechanism to generically identify the pipe fitting type. Subcategories of pipe fittings are not enumerated.

> HISTORY  New enumeration in IFC2x2.

## Items

### BEND
A fitting with typically two ports used to change the direction of flow between connected elements.

### CONNECTOR
Connector fitting, typically used to join two ports together within a flow distribution system (e.g., a coupling used to join two pipe segments).

### ENTRY
Entry fitting, typically unconnected at one port and connected to a flow distribution system at the other (e.g., a breeching inlet).

### EXIT
Exit fitting, typically unconnected at one port and connected to a flow distribution system at the other (e.g., a hose bibb).

### JUNCTION
A fitting with typically more than two ports used to redistribute flow among the ports and/or to change the direction of flow between connected elements (e.g, tee, cross, wye, etc.).

### OBSTRUCTION
A fitting with typically two ports used to obstruct or restrict flow between the connected elements (e.g., screen, perforated plate, etc.).

### TRANSITION
A fitting with typically two ports having different shapes or sizes. Can also be used to change the direction of flow between connected elements.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined fitting.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined fitting.
