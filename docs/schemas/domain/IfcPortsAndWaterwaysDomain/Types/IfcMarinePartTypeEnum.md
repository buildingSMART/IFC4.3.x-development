# IfcMarinePartTypeEnum

The predefined type container that collects all possible marine facility part types together into the implemented enumeration.

## Items

### CREST
A lateral spatial part that forms the crest area of breakwater or embankment where additional structures are placed such as access items or roads.

### MANUFACTURING
A region spatial part that forms a sub division of a facility for the purpose of manufacturing. This covers areas that are open air and do not constitute a building or the building is only a small part of the entire area (in this case a child of type building can be used).

### LOWWATERLINE
A vertical spatial part that represents the elevation of the low waterline, multiple low waterlines can be used to represent the different low tide types.

### CORE
A lateral spatial part that sub divides the core structure of a facility such as a breakwater or embankment

### WATERFIELD
A region or lateral facility part that covers the water field of a waterside facility such as a quay.

### CILL_LEVEL
A vertical spatial part that represents the elevation of the cill and floor level of an impounded facility such as a ship lock or dry lock.

### BERTHINGSTRUCTURE
A longitudinal spatial part of a waterway or port facility that provides facilities for the berthing of vessels while waiting for the waterway facility to become available. For example waiting for a lock cycle to complete and the lock gates to open.

### COPELEVEL
A vertical spatial part that represents the elevation working surface of the quay for the placement of quay furniture and plant.

### CHAMBER
A longitudinal spatial part of a waterway or port facility that forms the impounded chamber of a facility, such as a ship lock, dry dock or hydrolift

### STORAGEAREA
A region spatial part that forms a sub division of a facility for the purpose of storing cargo. For example container stacks, dry bulk storage yards, material storage yards.

### APPROACHCHANNEL
A longitudinal spatial part of a waterway or port facility that covers the approach of the primary facility.

### VEHICLESERVICING
A region spatial part that represents a functional division designed for the maintenance and/or storage of vehicles used for facility operations.

### SHIPTRANSFER
A region spatial part that represents a clear area used for the transfer and movement of vessels this area could include complex rail tracks and additional loading requirements.

### GATEHEAD
A longitudinal spatial part of a waterway or port facility that forms the gate, supporting structure &amp; plant of an impounded facility such as a ship lock, dry dock or hydrolift.

### GUDINGSTRUCTURE
A longitudinal spatial part of a waterway or port facility that forms the guiding and assistive structures at the entrance to an impounded facility.

### BELOWWATERLINE
A vertical spatial part that represents the part below the mean waterline defined within the site area.

### WEATHERSIDE
A lateral spatial part that covers the side of protective structures that is designed to protect and be impacted by weather or wave effects. such as the outer side of breakwaters or the riverside of flood embankments.

### LANDFIELD
A region or lateral facility part that covers the land field of a waterside facility such as a quay.

### PROTECTION
A lateral or region spatial part that forms the area which contains protective measures for scour and erosion of a facility.

### LEEWARDSIDE
A lateral spatial part that covers the side of protective structures that do not experience weather or wave effects.

### ABOVEWATERLINE
A vertical spatial part that represents the part above the mean waterline defined within the site area.

### ANCHORAGE
A region spatial part that represents a managed area for the anchorage of vessels awaiting space and conditions to enter a port.

### NAVIGATIONALAREA
A region spatial part that covers a managed navigational area that is maintained for an operational reason, this could be a dredged turning circle or waiting area.

### HIGHWATERLINE
A vertical spatial part that represents the elevation of the high waterline, multiple high waterlines can be used to represent the different high tide types.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
