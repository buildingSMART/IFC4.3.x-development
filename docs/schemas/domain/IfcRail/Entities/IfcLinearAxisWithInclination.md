# IfcLinearAxisWithInclination

An IfcLinearAxisWithInclination is a linear geometric representation item, which is defined based on a 3D curve and additional geometric representation that defines the lateral inclination profile based on the curve. This lateral inclination profile does not change the shape of the curve, but may have effect when the curve is used for linear placement or creating other geometric representation items.
