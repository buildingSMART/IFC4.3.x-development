# Pset_CurrentInstrumentTransformer

Instrument transformers are high accuracy class electrical devices used to isolate or transform voltage or current levels. The main function of instrument transformers is to operate instruments or metering from high voltage or high current circuits, safely isolating secondary control circuitry from the high voltages or currents. Combination instrument transformers are metering current.<!-- end of definition -->
