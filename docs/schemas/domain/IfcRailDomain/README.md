IfcRailDomain
=============

The _IfcRailDomain_ schema defines specific object concepts used in the rail domain that have not been covered in lower level schemas or schemas in the same level.

> NOTE  Most elements used in the rail domain are shared with other domains and are consequently declared in lower level schemas or schemas in the same level, such as _IfcProductExtension_, _IfcSharedInfrastructureElements_, _IfcSharedBldgElements_, _IfcSharedBldgServiceElements_, or _IfcElectricalDomain_.

Specific rail elements that are not already covered by other schemas are defined here:

* different types of rails for ensuring guidance of moving for vehicles or other kinds of machineries.
* specific elements used in the track sub-domain, e.g. sleeper, frog, derailer, etc.
* spatial structrue types for breaking down railway projects.

> HISTORY  New schema in IFC4.3
