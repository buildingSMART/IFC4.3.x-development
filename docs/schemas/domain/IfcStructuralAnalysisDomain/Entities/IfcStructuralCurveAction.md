# IfcStructuralCurveAction

A structural curve action defines an action which is distributed over a curve. A curve action may be connected with a curve member or curve connection, or surface member or surface connection.<!-- end of definition -->

****Coordinate Systems****:

See definitions at _IfcStructuralActivity_.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Standard Case:
If connected with a curve item, instances of _IfcStructuralCurveAction_ shall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_. It is implied that the placement and representation of the _IfcStructuralActivity_ is the same as the ones of the member or connection.

Special Case 1:
If connected with a surface item, instances of _IfcStructuralCurveAction_ shall have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcEdgeCurve_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

Special Case 2:
If not connected with a structural item (which may happen in an incomplete or conceptual model), a curve action should have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcEdgeCurve_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

**Informal Propositions**

1. If the curve action is of the predefined type CONST, SINUS, or PARABOLA, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ must not be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_. In case of SINUS and PARABOLA, the load item defines the maximum of the load at the centre of the load distribution.
2. If the curve action is of the predefined type LINEAR, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain two items.
3. If the curve action is of the predefined type POLYGONAL, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain three or more items.
4. If the curve action is of the predefined type DISCRETE, _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad_ shall be of type _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration_ and shall contain two or more items.
5. In case of types LINEAR, POLYGONAL, and DISCRETE, the load items shall have one-dimensional _IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Locations_, defining the location of the load samples in local coordinates of the curve action. The load items shall be provided in ascending order according to their locations. The first and the last load item define the extent of the load distribution.
6. Point actions must be of type DISCRETE, thus contain two or more load points. (Single point loads are modeled by _IfcStructuralPointAction_.)
7. All items in _SELF\IfcStructuralActivity.AppliedLoad\IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration.Values_ shall be of the same entity type.

## Attributes

### ProjectedOrTrue
Defines whether load values are given per true length of the curve on which they act, or per length of the projection of the curve in load direction. The latter is only applicable to loads which act in global coordinate directions.

### PredefinedType
Type of action according to its distribution of load values.

## Formal Propositions

### ProjectedIsGlobal
A load can only be related to projected length if it was specified in global coordinate directions (i.e. in analysis model coordinate directions). If a load was specified in local coordinate directions, it can only relate to true length.

### HasObjectType
The attribute ObjectType shall be given if the predefined type is set to USERDEFINED.

### SuitablePredefinedType
The EQUIDISTANT distribution type is out of scope of structural curve actions.

## Concepts

### Structural Activity



#### IfcStructuralLoadLinearForce_IfcStructuralCurveMember

Linear force and moment along a curve member.

#### IfcStructuralLoadLinearForce_IfcStructuralSurfaceMember

Linear force and moment positioned within a surface member.
