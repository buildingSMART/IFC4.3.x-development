# IfcStructuralPointReaction

This entity defines a reaction which occurs at a point. A point reaction is typically connected with a point connection. It may also be connected with a curve member or curve connection, or surface member or surface connection.

****Coordinate Systems****:

See definitions at _IfcStructuralActivity_.

****Topology Use Definitions****:

Standard Case:
If connected with a point item, instances of _IfcStructuralPointReaction_ shall not have an _ObjectPlacement_ nor a _Representation_. It is implied that the placement and representation of the reaction is the same as the structural item.

Special Case 1:
If connected with a curve item or surface item, instances of _IfcStructuralPointReaction_ shall have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcVertexPoint_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

> NOTE In order to model concentrated reactions on a curve or surface item, _IfcStructuralCurveReaction_ or _IfcStructuralSurfaceAction_ of type DISCRETE is preferable since they do not require an extra topology representation in this case. An _IfcStructuralPointReaction_ should be used for a concentrated reaction on a curve or surface item only when an explicit vertex point representation is actually desired.

Special Case 2:
If not connected with a structural item (which may happen in an incomplete or conceptual model), a point action should have an _ObjectPlacement_ and _Representation_, containing an _IfcVertexPoint_. See _IfcStructuralActivity_ for further definitions.

## Formal Propositions

### SuitableLoadType
A structural point reaction shall have as a result either a single force or a single displacement.

## Concepts

### Structural Activity



#### IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce_IfcStructuralPointConnection

Force and moment reactions at supported point connections.

#### IfcStructuralLoadSingleDisplacement_IfcStructuralPointConnection

Translation and rotation at point connections.
