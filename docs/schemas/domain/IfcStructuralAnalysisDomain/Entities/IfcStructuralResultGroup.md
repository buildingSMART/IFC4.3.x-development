# IfcStructuralResultGroup

Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralResultGroup_ are used to group results of structural analysis calculations and to capture the connection to the underlying basic load group. The basic functionality for grouping inherited from _IfcGroup_ is used to collect instances from _IfcStructuralReaction_ or its respective subclasses.<!-- end of definition -->
