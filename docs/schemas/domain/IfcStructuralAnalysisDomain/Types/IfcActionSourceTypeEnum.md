# IfcActionSourceTypeEnum

This enumeration type contains possible action sources.

> HISTORY  New enumeration in IFC2x2.

## Items

### DEAD_LOAD_G
The structure carries the dead load, which includes its own weight, the weight of any permanent non-structural partitions, built-in cupboards, floor surfacing materials and other finishes.

### COMPLETION_G1
Completion.

### LIVE_LOAD_Q
All the movable objects in a building such as people, desks, cupboards and filing cabinets produce an imposed load on the structure. This loading may come and go with the result that its intensity will vary considerably. At one moment a room may be empty, yet at another packed with people.

### SNOW_S
The magnitude of the snow load will depend upon the latitude and altitude of the site. In the lower latitudes no snow would be expected while in the high latitudes snow could last for six months or more.

### WIND_W
The wind acts both on the main structure and on the individual cladding units. The structure has to be braced to resist the horizontal load and anchored to the ground to prevent the whole building from being blown away, if the dead weight of the building is not sufficient to hold it down.

### PRESTRESSING_P
Presstressing load.

### SETTLEMENT_U
If one part of a building settles more than another part, then stresses are set up in the structures.

### TEMPERATURE_T
All building materials expand or contract with temperature change. Long continuous buildings will expand, and it is necessary to consider the expansion stresses.

### EARTHQUAKE_E
Earthquake loads affect the design of structures in areas of great seismic activity.

### FIRE
Fire action on the build facility.

### IMPULSE
Load from impulse force.

### IMPACT
Impact force from an object hitting the facility.

### TRANSPORT
Loads from transport.

### ERECTION
Loads on the facility that occur during erection, but not after completion.

### PROPPING
Propping

### SYSTEM_IMPERFECTION
Loads from imperfections in the system.

### SHRINKAGE
Loads from shrinkage.

### CREEP
Forces due to creep.

### LACK_OF_FIT
Lack of fit.

### BUOYANCY
Buoyancy.

### ICE
Loads from ice.

### CURRENT
Current.

### WAVE
Loads from a wave hitting the structure.

### RAIN
Rain and water on the structure.

### BRAKES
Brakes

### USERDEFINED
User defined. See objectType for user defined type.

### NOTDEFINED
Not defined.
