# IfcAnalysisTheoryTypeEnum

This enumeration is used to distinguish between different types of structural analysis methods, including first order theory, second order theory (small deformations), third order theory (large deformations) and the full nonlinear theory (geometric nonlinearity together with other nonlinearities such as plasticity).<!-- end of definition -->
