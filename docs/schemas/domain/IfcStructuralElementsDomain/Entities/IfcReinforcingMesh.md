A reinforcing mesh is a series of longitudinal and transverse wires or bars of various gauges, arranged at right angles to each other and welded at all points of intersection; usually used for concrete slab reinforcement. It is also known as welded wire fabric. In scope are plane meshes as well as bent meshes.

Geometry Use Definition

Placement and representation are defined at the supertype _IfcElementComponent_.

The representation map of a mapped 'Outline' representation should contain a representation of type 'Curve3D' which holds an _IfcPolyline_.

The representation map of a mapped 'Body' representation should contain a representation of type 'AdvancedSweptSolid' which holds multiple _IfcSweptDiskSolid_ (including subtype _IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal_).

## Attributes

### MeshLength
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### MeshWidth
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### LongitudinalBarNominalDiameter
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### TransverseBarNominalDiameter
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### LongitudinalBarCrossSectionArea
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### TransverseBarCrossSectionArea
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### LongitudinalBarSpacing
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### TransverseBarSpacing
Deprecated.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute made optional and deprecated. Use respective attribute at _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ instead.

### PredefinedType
Kind of mesh.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
If this occurrence is defined by a type object, the latter has to be an _IfcReinforcingMeshType_.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

### Mapped Geometry

The representation map referenced by a 'Body' 'MappedRepresentation' could contain a representation of type 'AdvancedSweptSolid' which holds an IfcSweptDiskSolid (including subtype IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal). Multiple IfcMappedItem's can be used to represent the bars within a mesh as one occurrence of IfcReinforcingMesh.
