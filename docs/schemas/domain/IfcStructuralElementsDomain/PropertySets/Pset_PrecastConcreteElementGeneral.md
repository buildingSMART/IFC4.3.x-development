# Pset_PrecastConcreteElementGeneral

Production and manufacturing related properties common to different types of precast concrete elements. The Pset can be used by a number of subtypes of IfcBuiltElement. If the precast concrete element is a sandwich wall panel each structural layer or shell represented by an IfcBuildingElementPart may be attached to a separate Pset of this type, if needed. Some of the properties apply only for specific types of precast concrete elements.<!-- end of definition -->
