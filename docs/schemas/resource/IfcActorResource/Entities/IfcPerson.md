This entity represents an individual human being.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Many countries have legislation concerning the identification of individual persons within databases. Although the intent of the IFC Model is to act as a specification for data exchange and sharing, an IFC file might in some situations be considered to be a database that enables identification of a particular person under the terms of such legislation. Users should be aware of the constraints of legislation that might apply in the places where IFC files are used.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **person** defined in ISO 10303-41.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5.1.
