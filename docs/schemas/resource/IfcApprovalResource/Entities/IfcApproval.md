# IfcApproval

An _IfcApproval_ represents information about approval processes such as for a plan, a design, a proposal, or a change order in a construction or facilities management project. _IfcApproval_ is referenced by _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_ in _IfcControlExtension_ schema, and thereby can be related to all subtypes of _IfcRoot_. An approval may also be given to resource objects using _IfcResourceApprovalRelationship_
