IfcApprovalResource
===================

The _IfcApprovalResource_ schema in the resource layer defines basic concepts for approvals to be assigned to any object or object type or property definition in the IFC model derived from _IfcRoot_. The assignment is done using _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_ in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema. Also, approvals can be assigned to specific resource level objects (documents, properties, persons/organizations or materials), using _IfcResourceApprovalRelationship_.
