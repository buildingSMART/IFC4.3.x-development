# IfcObjective

An _IfcObjective_ captures qualitative information for an objective-based constraint.
<!-- end of short definition -->

_IfcObjective_ is a subtype of _IfcConstraint_ and may be associated with any subtype of _IfcRoot_ through the _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ relationship in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema, or may be associated with _IfcProperty_ by _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_.

The aim of _IfcObjective_ is to specify the purpose for which the constraint is applied and to capture the benchmark metrics of the constraint.

## Attributes

### BenchmarkValues
A list of nested constraints.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC2X4 CHANGE Modified to be a LIST of nested constraints, which replaces the former _IfcConstraintAggregationRelationship_.

### LogicalAggregator
Enumeration that identifies the logical type of aggregation for the benchmark metrics.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC2X4 CHANGE This attribute replaces replaces the former _ResultValues_ attribute and indicates the aggregation behavior formerly defined at _IfcConstraintAggregationRelationship_.

### ObjectiveQualifier
Enumeration that qualifies the type of objective constraint.

### UserDefinedQualifier
A user defined value that qualifies the type of objective constraint when ObjectiveQualifier attribute of type _IfcObjectiveEnum_ has value USERDEFINED.

## Formal Propositions

### WR21
The attribute UserDefinedQualifier must be asserted when the value of the ObjectiveQualifier is set to USERDEFINED.
