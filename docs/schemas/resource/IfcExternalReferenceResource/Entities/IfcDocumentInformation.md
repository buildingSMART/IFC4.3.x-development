# IfcDocumentInformation

_IfcDocumentInformation_ captures "metadata" of an external document. The actual content of the document is not defined in this specification; instead, it can be found following the _Location_ attribute.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The same _IfcDocumentInformation_ can be referenced from the exchange structure in total or in parts (e.g. by referring to particular chapters or paragraphs) using the _IfcDocumentReference_. All _IfcDocumentReference_'s that utilize the _IfcDocumentInformation_ are accessible by the inverse relationship _HasDocumentReferences_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Attribute _HasDocumentReferences_ changed to be inverse, attribute _Location_ added, and attribute _ElectronicFormat_ modified.
