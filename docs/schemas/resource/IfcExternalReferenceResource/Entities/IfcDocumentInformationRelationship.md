# IfcDocumentInformationRelationship

An _IfcDocumentInformationRelationship_ is a relationship entity that enables a document to have the ability to reference other documents. It is used to describe relationships in which one document may reference one or more other sub documents or where a document is used as a replacement for another document (but where both the original and the replacing document need to be retained).
