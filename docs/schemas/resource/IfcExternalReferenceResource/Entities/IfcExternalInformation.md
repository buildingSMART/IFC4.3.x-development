# IfcExternalInformation

An _IfcExternalInformation_ is the identification of an information source that is not explicitly represented in the current model or in the project database (as an implementation of the current model). The _IfcExternalInformation_ identifies the external source (classification, document, or library), but not the particular items such as a dictionary entry, a classification notation, or a document reference within the external source

The _IfcExternalInformation_ is an abstract supertype of all external information entities.
