# IfcLibraryInformation

An _IfcLibraryInformation_ describes an external structured store of information, normally organized in a manner which allows information lookup through an index or reference value. _IfcLibraryInformation_ provides the library _Name_ and optional _Description_, _Version_, _VersionDate_ and _Publisher_ attributes. A _Location_ may be added for electronic access to the library.

> EXAMPLE A library may be an external network of elements in a Building Automation System structured using BACnet or Brickschema. Alternatively, a library may reference an external revision control system. A library may also reference an arbitrary external database.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.
