# IfcLibrarySelect

The _IfcLibrarySelect_ enables selection of whether library information is to be contained within an IFC model or is to be referenced from an external source.
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .note}
> It is expected that selection will be _IfcLibraryReference_ and only rarely _IfcLibraryInformation_. _IfcLibraryInformation_ should only be selected in circumstances where there could be a need to indicate the libraries that will be used without making individual references. This may occur for higher level objects such as a _IfcProject_ or _IfcBuilding_.
