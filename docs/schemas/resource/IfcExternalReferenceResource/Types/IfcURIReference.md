# IfcURIReference

The _IfcURIReference_ provides for identifying a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). A URI can be classified as a locator or a name or both, that is it may comprise a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and/or a Uniform Resource Name (URN).<!-- end of definition -->

* A Uniform Resource Locator, URL, is a string conforming to a standardized format, which refers to a resource on the internet (such as a document or an image) by its location.
* A Uniform Resource Name, URN, is intended to serve as persistent, location-independent resource identifier and is designed to make it easy to map other namespaces (that share the properties of URNs) into URN-space.

> NOTE See [RFC 3986](../content/bibliography.htm#RFC-3986) for definition of Uniform Resource Identifier.

> HISTORY New defined datatype in IFC4.
