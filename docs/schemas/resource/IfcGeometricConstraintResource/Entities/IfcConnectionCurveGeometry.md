# IfcConnectionCurveGeometry

_IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_ is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the physical connection of two objects at a curve or at an edge with curve geometry associated. It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection relationships.<!-- end of definition -->

The _IfcCurve_ (or the _IfcEdgeCurve_ with an associated _IfcCurve_) at the _CurveOnRelatingElement_ attribute defines the curve where the basic geometry items of the connected elements connects. The curve geometry and coordinates are provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatingElement_, as specified at the _IfcRelConnects_ subtype that utilizes the _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_. Optionally, the same curve geometry and coordinates can also be provided within the local coordinate system of the _RelatedElement_ by using the _CurveOnRelatedElement_ attribute.

> EXAMPLE  The connection relationship between two walls has a geometric constraint which describes the end caps (or cut-off of the wall ends) by a _CurveOnRelatingElement_ for the first wall and a _CurveOnRelatedElement_ for the second wall. The exact usage of the _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry_ is further defined in the geometry use sections of the elements that use it.

The available geometry for the connection constraint may be further restricted to only allow straight segments by applying _IfcPolyline_ only. Such an usage constraint is provided at the object definition of the _IfcElement_ subtype, utilizing the element connection by referring to the subtype of _IfcRelConnects_ with the associated _IfcConnectionCurveGeometry._

> IFC2x3 CHANGE  The provision of topology with associated geometry, _IfcEdgeCurve_, is enabled by using the _IfcCurveOrEdgeCurve_.

## Attributes

### CurveOnRelatingElement
The bounded curve at which the connected objects are aligned at the relating element, given in the LCS of the relating element.

### CurveOnRelatedElement
The bounded curve at which the connected objects are aligned at the related element, given in the LCS of the related element. If the information is omitted, then the origin of the related element is used.
