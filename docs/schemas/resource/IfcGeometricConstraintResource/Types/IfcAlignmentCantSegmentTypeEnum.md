# IfcAlignmentCantSegmentTypeEnum

The IfcAlignmentCantSegmentTypeEnum indicates the type of a segment of a cant alignment segment (IfcAlignmentCantSegment).

Cant is defined as the amount by which one running rail is raised above the other running rail, in a track cross section.
>NOTE Definition according to EN 13803/2017

For 3D modeling both the cant value and the cant angle (bank angle, lateral angle, cross slope angle) are relevant.

The relation between cant value **D**, Railhead distance **b** and cant angle **&psi;** is shown below.

$$ \displaylines {
\psi = \arcsin \frac{D}{b}  \\\\
\sin \psi \approx \psi \approx  \tan \psi
} $$

>NOTE in contemporary track engineering &psi; is approximated by sinus of &psi; or tangens of &psi; very often.



| Variation of Cant | Segmenttype        | Enumeration Values |
|:----|:------------------|:----------|
| 0 |  both rails without relative elevation        | CONSTANTCANT  |
| constant in the complete segment, <> 0 | elevated rail  | CONSTANTCANT |
| variation along the segment | Transition with linear cant variation | LINEARTRANSITION   |
| variation along the segment | Transition with non-linear cant variation | HELMERTCURVE, BLOSSCURVE, COSINECURVE, SINECURVE, VIENNESEBEND |

### Cant variation in high performance transition bends

While for combinations of horizontal clothoids and linear cant transitions the extension along the base line differs in some cases, curvature transition and cant transition for high performance horizontal transition bends are expected to have the same start position and end position. In some regulations the same linear extension requirement is mandatory for high performance transition bends.

Whether the cant variation is defined by the same base formula as the curvature of the corresponding horizontal high performance transition bend or by a linear ramp also might differ between regulations.

## Items

### BLOSSCURVE
Non linear cant variation according to Bloss curve base formula.  <br/><br/>


**Base formula (Cant)**

$$ \displaylines{
\xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
D(s) = D_{1} + (3 - 2\xi) \cdot   \xi^2 \  \Delta D
} $$

### CONSTANTCANT
For horizontal straight lines, compensation of lateral acceleration is not required and should be avoided. Therefore the applied cant value is constant 0.

For horizontal circular arcs, compensation of lateral acceleration is very common. In these cases the applied cant value is constant value greater 0.

**Base formula (Cant)**

$$ D=Const $$

### COSINECURVE
Non linear cant variation according to Cosine curve base formula. <br/><br/>
