# IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum

The IfcAlignmentVerticalSegmentTypeEnum indicates the type of a segment of a vertical alignment segment (IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment).<!-- end of definition -->


| Vertical curvature | Segmenttype    | Enumeration Values |
|:----|:------------------|:----------|
| No vertical curvature | constant gradient    | CONSTANTGRADIENT |
| Derivative of gradient with respect to horizontal projection of alignment is constant | Vertical curve, parabola | PARABOLICARC |
| Derivative of vertical angle with respect to 3D arc length along the alignment is constant | Vertical curve, circular | CIRCULARARC |
| Variation of vertical curvature is constant | Vertical curve, clothoid | CLOTHOID |


> NOTE A vertical curve in track that starts or ends in canted switches and crossings can be of a higher order polynomial than a parabola.

> NOTE chainage is longitudinal distance along the horizontal projection of the alignment (e.g. track centre line).


> NOTE Definitions according to EN 13803/2017 (except CLOTHOID)

> NOTE Symbols according to EN 13803/2017

> NOTE gradient has a slightly different definition in civil engineering. "Gradient (Civ.Eng.) is the degree of slope, e.g. of a highway or a railway. US grade".

> NOTE most railway track designs use the **small angle assumption**. That means θ=tan(θ)=gradient.

**References to EN 13803/2017**

EN 13803/2017 covers "Track alignment design parameters". As such it is not fully compatible with definitions for IFC Alignment. Therefore rail specific terms like track have been replaced with more general terms also applicable to road design.

Referenced content of EN 13803/2017 "Table 2 - Elements for vertical alignment" has been modified as follows:

**Vertical curve, parabola:** Derivative of gradient with respect to chainage is constant<br/>
**Generalized:** Derivative of gradient with respect to horizontal projection of alignment is constant

**Vertical curve, circular:** Derivative of vertical angle with respect to sloping length along the track is constant<br/>
**Generalized:** Derivative of vertical angle with respect to 3D arc length along the alignment is constant

EN13803 clause 3.5:
**Chainage**: longitudinal distance along the horizontal projection of the track centre line.

## Items

### CONSTANTGRADIENT
Vertical alignment segment with constant gradient.

### CIRCULARARC
Vertical alignment segment where the derivative of vertical angle with respect to sloping length along the track (3D length) is constant.

The curvature for vertical circular arc segment is provided by:

$$ \kappa_v = \frac{1}{R_v(s)} = \frac{d\theta}{ds} $$

The length for vertical circular arc segment is provided by:

$$ l_V =\Delta s_v = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\kappa_v} = \Delta \theta \cdot R_v $$

The distance between point on segment to tangent is provided by:

$$ z_c(s) = \frac{s^2}{2\cdot R_v} $$

### PARABOLICARC
Vertical alignment segment where the derivative of gradient with respect to distance along is constant.
<br/>

General equation of the parabolic arc segment is provided by:

$$ y = a x^2 + b x + c $$

The gradient (slope) of this curve at any point (first derivative) is provided by:

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2 a x + b $$

The rate of change of gradient of the parabolic arc segment is constant. The variation of curvature is therefore provided by:

$$ \frac{d^2y}{d^2x} = 2 a $$

### CLOTHOID

Vertical alignment segment where the derivative of vertical angle with respect to sloping length along the track (3D length) obeys a linear change.

The curvature equation of the vertical clothoid segment is provided by:
$$ \displaylines {
\xi = \frac{s}{L} \\\\
\kappa_v(s) = \kappa_{v1} + \xi \Delta \kappa_v
} $$
