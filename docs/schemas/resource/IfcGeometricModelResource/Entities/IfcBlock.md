# IfcBlock

The _IfcBlock_ is a Construction Solid Geometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is defined by a position and a positive distance along the three orthogonal axes. The inherited _Position_ attribute has the _IfcAxis2Placement3D_ type and provides:

* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position_: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location_: The block has one vertex at location and the edges are aligned with the placement axes in the positive sense.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _XLength_, _YLength_, and _ZLength_ attributes define the size of the IfcBlock along the three axes.

Figure 1 — Block geometry

Figure 1 illustrates geometric parameters of a block where the block positioned within its own placement
coordinate system. The values for <em>XLength</em>, <em>YLength</em>, and <em>ZLength</em> are applied to the positive
direction of the X, Y, and Z axis.

> NOTE Definition according to ISO 10303-42
> A block is a type of geometric representation item which is a solid rectangular parallelepiped, defined with a location and placement coordinate system. The block is specified by the positive lengths x, y, and z along the axes of the placement coordinate system, and has one vertex at the origin of the placement coordinate system.

Texture definition

On each side face, textures are aligned facing upright. On the top and bottom faces, textures are aligned facing front-to-back. Textures are stretched or repeated to the extent of each face according to _RepeatS_ and _RepeatT_.

Figure 2 illustrates default texture mapping with a clamped texture (RepeatS=False and RepeatT=False). The image on the left shows the texture where the S axis points to the right and the T axis points up. The image on the right shows the texture applied to the geometry where the X axis points back to the right, the Y axis points back to the left, and the Z axis points up.

## Attributes

### XLength
The size of the block along the placement X axis. It is provided by the inherited axis placement through _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.P[1]_.

### YLength
The size of the block along the placement Y axis. It is provided by the inherited axis placement through _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.P[2]_.

### ZLength
The size of the block along the placement Z axis. It is provided by the inherited axis placement through _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.P[3]_.
