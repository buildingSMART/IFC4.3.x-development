# IfcBoundingBox

The _IfcBoundingBox_ defines an orthogonal box oriented parallel to the axes of the object coordinate system in which it is defined. It is defined by a _Corner_ being a three-dimensional Cartesian point and three length measures defining the X, Y and Z parameters of the box in the direction of the positive axes.

> NOTE&nbsp; Any subtype of _IfcProduct_ having a product shape representation may have a bounding box representation. The 'Box' representation identifier defined at IfcShapeRepresentation utilizes the _IfcBoundingBox_ as the simpliest 3D shape representation.

Figure 1 &mdash; Bounding box

As shown in Figure 1, the <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> is defined with its own location which can be used to place the <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> relative to the geometric coordinate system. The <em>IfcBoundingBox</em> is defined by the lower left corner (<em>Corner</em>) and the upper right corner (<em>XDim, YDim, ZDim</em> measured within the parent co-ordinate system).

> NOTE&nbsp; Corresponding STEP type **box_domain** defined in ISO 10303-42.
