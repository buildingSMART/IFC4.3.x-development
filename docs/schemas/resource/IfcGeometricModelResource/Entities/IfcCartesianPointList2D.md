# IfcCartesianPointList2D

The _IfcCartesianPointList2D_ defines an ordered collection of two-dimentional Cartesian points. Each Cartesian point is provided as an two-dimensional point by a fixed list of two coordinates. The attribute _CoordList_ is a two-dimensional list, where
<!-- end of short definition -->

* first dimension is an unbounded list representing each 2D Cartesian point;
* second dimension is a fixed list of two list members, where [1] is the x-coordinate, and [2] the y-coordinate of the Cartesian point.

> NOTE The _IfcCartesianPointList2D_ is introduced to provide a compact representation of larger list of points, such as in indexable representation of points used as vertices in poly curves.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4 ADD1.

## Attributes

### CoordList
Two-dimensional list of Cartesian points provided by two coordinates.

### TagList
List of tags corresponding to each point that may be used to identify a basis curve according to the Tag attribute at _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_. Also used to identify _IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal_ or _IfcSectionedSurface_ shape string lines ("guide curves") when used within an _IfcProfileDef_ curve of type _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_.
