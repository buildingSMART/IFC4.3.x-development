# IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel

The _IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel_ represents the a shape by connected face sets. The connected faces have a dimensionality 2 and are placed in a coordinate space of dimensionality 3.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A face based surface model is described by a set of connected face sets of dimensionality 2. The connected face sets shall not intersect except at edges and vertices, except that a face in one connected face set may overlap a face in another connected face set, provided the face boundaries are identical. There shall be at least one connected face set.
> A connected face set may exist independently of a surface model.

> NOTE  Entity adapted from **face_based_surface_model** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The connected face sets shall not overlap or intersect except at common faces, edges or vertices.
2. The fbsm faces have dimensionality 2.
