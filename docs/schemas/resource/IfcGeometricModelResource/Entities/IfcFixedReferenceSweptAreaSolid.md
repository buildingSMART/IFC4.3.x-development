# IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid

An _IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid_ is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along a _Directrix_. The swept area is provided by a subtype of _IfcProfileDef_. The profile is placed by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees to the start tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the orthogonal projection of the _FixedReference_ direction within the plane of start tangent and _Fixed_Reference_. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the _FixedReference_ direction.<!-- end of definition -->

The _SweptArea_ is swept along the _Directrix_ in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the _SweptArea_ is on the _Directrix_ and the local x-axis is in the direction of the projection of _FixedReference_ onto the normal plane to the directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the _Directrix_ at any point is a copy of the _SweptArea_. The resulting swept solid is placed by the _Position_ coordinate system.

The _Directrix_ and the _ReferenceSurface_ are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the _StartParam_, being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no _StartParam_ is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the _EndParam_, being either the parameter value based on the curve parameterization, or by a length measured along the directrix from its beginning. If no _EndParam_ is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix.

> NOTE The _StartParam_ and the _EndParam_, if provided as a parameter value, are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the _IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment_ within an _IfcCompositeCurve_ as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve.

> NOTE In the case of a curve composed of _IfcCurveSegment_, the _IfcSweptAreaSolid_ _Position_ is dependent on the _IfcCurveSegment_ _StartPlacement_ and the type of _BasisCurve_ which defines the _name-function_ between the start and end (explicitly defined as the start point of the next segment) points of the segment

> EXAMPLE The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In many cases, it is a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, often defined as a p-curve at this reference surface. At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the _FixedReference_ direction. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed. In this case the resulting swept solid is not repositioned.

The orientation of the _SweptArea_ as it sweeps along the _Directrix_ is precisely defined by a _CartesianTransformationOperator3d_ with attributes:

* _LocalOrigin_ as point (0; 0; 0),
* _Axis1_ as the orthogonal projection of the _FixedReference_ onto the normal plane defined by _Axis3_.
* _Axis3_ as the direction of the tangent vector **t** at the point of the _Directrix_ with parameter **u**.

The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix **T(u)**, which varies with the _Directrix_ parameter **u**.

> NOTE The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization; the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the _Directrix_.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **fixed_reference_swept_surface** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

**Informal Propositions**
