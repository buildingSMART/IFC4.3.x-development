# IfcSweptAreaSolid

An _IfcSweptAreaSolid_ represents the 3D shape by a sweeping representation scheme allowing a two dimensional planar cross section to sweep through space.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The swept area is defined by a cross section, represented by a subtype if _IfcProfileDef_, that is provided as a closed two-dimensional boundary on an implicit plane. The swept area is defined in the xy plane of the object coordinate system. The sweeping operation is applied to the swept area as defined within the subtypes of _IfcSweptAreaSolid_, some subtypes require an implicit transformation of the swept area to the start position of the sweep.

The optional _Position_ coordinate system allows for re-positioning the resulting swept solid relative to the object coordinate system.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> The swept area solid entity collects the entities which are defined procedurally by sweeping action on planar bounded surfaces. The position is space of the swept solid will be dependent upon the position of the swept area. The swept area will be a face of the resulting swept area solid, except for the case of a revolved area solid with angle equal to 2Ï€ (or 360 degrees).

## Attributes

### SweptArea
The surface defining the area to be swept. It is given as a profile definition within the xy plane of the position coordinate system.

### Position
Position coordinate system for the resulting swept solid of the sweeping operation. The position coordinate system allows for re-positioning of the swept solid. If not provided, the swept solid remains within the position as determined by the cross section or by the directrix used for the sweeping operation.

## Formal Propositions

### SweptAreaType
The profile definition for the swept area solid shall be of type AREA.
