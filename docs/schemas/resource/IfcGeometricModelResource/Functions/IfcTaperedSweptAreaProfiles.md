# IfcTaperedSweptAreaProfiles

This function checks whether the start and end profile in a tapered extrusion are topologically similar, i.e. whether both have the same number of vertices and edges.
<!-- end of short definition -->

It returns TRUE if:

* The start profile is defined by a paramterized profile definition and
  * the end profile is either a derived profile, using the start profile as its parent profile, or
  * the end profile is based on the same subtype of the paramterized profile definition as the start profile
* The start profile is defined by an arbitrary bounded curve bounding a plane and
  * the end profile is a derived profile using the start profile as its parent profile
