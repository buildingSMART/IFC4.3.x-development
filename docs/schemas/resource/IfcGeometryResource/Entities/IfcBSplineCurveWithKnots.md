# IfcBSplineCurveWithKnots

The _IfcBSplineCurveWithKnots_ is a spline curve parameterized by spline functions for which the knot values are explicitly given.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> This is the type of b-spline curve for which the knot values are explicitly given. This subtype shall be used to represent non-uniform B-spline curves and may be used for other knot types.  
> Let _L_ denote the number of distinct values amongst the _d_+_k_+2 knots in the knot list; _L_ will be referred to as the &lsquo;upper index on knots&rsquo;. Let _m~j~_ denote the multiplicity (i.e., number of repetitions) of the _j_th distinct knot. Then:

> All knot multiplicities except the first and the last shall be in the range 1,...,_d_; the first and last may have a maximum value of _d_ + 1. In evaluating the basis functions, a knot _u_ of, e.g., multiplicity 3 is interpreted as a sequence _u_, _u_, _u_,; in the knot array.

## Attributes

### KnotMultiplicities
The multiplicities of the knots. This list defines the number of times each knot in the knots list is to be repeated in constructing the knot array.

### Knots
The list of distinct knots used to define the B-spline basis functions.

### KnotSpec
The description of the knot type. This is for information only.

### UpperIndexOnKnots
The upper index on the knot arrays; the lower index is 1.

## Formal Propositions

### ConsistentBSpline
The function IfcConstraintsParamBSpline returns TRUE if no inconsistencies in the parametrisation of the
B-spline are found.

### CorrespondingKnotLists
The number of elements in the knot multiplicities list shall be equal to the number of elements in the knots list.
