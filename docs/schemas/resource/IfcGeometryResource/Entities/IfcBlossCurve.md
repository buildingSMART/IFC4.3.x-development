# IfcBlossCurve

The Bloss curve is a curve definition used in particular in rail transitions. It was proposed by Dr. Ing. Bloss.

It's parametrization is as follows:
X coordinate:  
![Image](../../figures/ifctransitioncurvetype-blosscurve-x.png)  
Y coordinate:  
![Image](../../figures/ifctransitioncurvetype-blosscurve-y.png)

where &Theta; is the deflection angle.
