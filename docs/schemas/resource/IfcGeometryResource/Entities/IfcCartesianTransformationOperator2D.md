# IfcCartesianTransformationOperator2D

An _IfcCartesianTransformationOperator2D_ defines a geometric transformation in two-dimensional space.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A Cartesian transformation operator 2d defines a geometric transformation in two-dimensional space composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix **T**. These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1 and axis2 by the base axis function. If **|T|= -1**, the transformation includes mirroring.

> NOTE  Entity adapted from **cartesian_transformation_operator_2d** defined in ISO10303-42.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.

## Attributes

### U
The list of mutually orthogonal, normalized vectors defining the transformation matrix T. They are derived from the explicit attributes Axis1 and Axis2 in that order.

## Formal Propositions
