# IfcCompositeCurveSegment

An _IfcCompositeCurveSegment_ is a bounded curve constructed for the sole purpose to be a segment within an _IfcCompositeCurve_.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A composite curve segment is a bounded curve together with transition information which is used to construct a composite curve.

> NOTE&nbsp; Entity adapted from **composite_curve_segment** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.0

## Attributes

### SameSense
An indicator of whether or not the sense of the segment agrees with, or opposes, that of the parent curve. If _SameSense_ is false, the point with highest parameter value is taken as the first point of the segment.
> NOTE&nbsp; If the datatype of _ParentCurve_ is _IfcTrimmedCurve_, the value of _SameSense_ overrides the value of _IfcTrimmedCurve.SenseAgreement_

### ParentCurve
The bounded curve which defines the geometry of the segment.

### Dim
The space dimensionality of this class, defined by the dimensionality of the first ParentCurve.

### UsingCurves
The set of composite curves which use this composite curve segment as a segment. This set shall not be empty.

## Formal Propositions

### ParentIsBoundedCurve
The parent curve shall be a bounded curve.
