> A conic is a planar curve which could be produced by intersecting a plane with a cone. A conic is defined in terms of its intrinsic geometric properties rather than being described in terms of other geometry. A conic entity always has a placement coordinate system defined by axis2_placement; the parametric representation is defined in terms of this placement coordinate system.
