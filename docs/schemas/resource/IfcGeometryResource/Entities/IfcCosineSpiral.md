# IfcCosineSpiral

*IfcCosineSpiral* is a type of spiral curve for which the curvature change is dependent on the cosine function.
<!-- end of short definition -->
The cosine spiral curve is parameterized by its curve length and for a given parameter $s$, the heading angle $\theta(s)$ and the curvature $\kappa(s)$ are defined as follows. Here, $A_0$ corresponds to the *ConstantTerm* and $A_1$ to the *CosineTerm*.

**Heading Angle:**

The *Heading Angle* $\theta(s)$ represents the orientation of the tangent to the curve at a given arc length. It indicates the direction in which the curve is "pointing" at that point. As you move along the curve, $\theta(s)$ changes, showing how the curveâ€™s direction evolves.

$$\theta(s) = \frac{1}{A_0} s \;+\; \frac{L}{\pi A_1} \sin\!\biggl(\frac{\pi}{L}s\biggr)$$

**Curvature:**

The *Curvature* $\kappa(s)$ describes how quickly the heading angle changes with respect to the arc length $s$. It reflects the "tightness" of the curve. Higher curvature values correspond to sharper bends, and lower curvature values correspond to straighter segments.

$$\kappa(s) = \frac{L}{A_0} \;+\; \frac{L}{A_1}\cos\!\biggl(\frac{\pi}{L}s\biggr)$$
