# IfcCylindricalSurface

The cylindrical surface is a surface unbounded in the direction of _z_. Bounded cylindrical surfaces are defined by using a subtype of _IfcBoundedSurface_ with _BasisSurface_ being a cylindrical surface.

> NOTE 1  A bounded cylindrical surface can be defined by an _IfcRectangularTrimmedSurface_ with _BasisSurface_ being the cylindrical surface and _U1_ = 0&deg;, _U2_ = 360&deg; and _V1_ = lower bound in **z**, _V2_ = upper bound in **z** (if the plane angle measure is degree). A bounded cylindrical arc surface is provided with |U1 - U2| < 360&deg; (assuming the Usense and Vsense agree to the sense of the basis surface).

> NOTE 2  A non-rectangular bounded cylindrical surface, e.g. the surface of a round wall underneath a sloped roof, cab be defined by an _IfcCurveBoundedSurface_ with _IfcBoundaryCurve_'s, being a collection of p-curve segments. A p-curve is curve which lies on the basis of a surface and is defined in the parameter space of that surface.

The inherited attributes are interpreted as

* _SELF\IfcElementarySurface.Position_ defines the location and orientation of the cylindrical surface.
* _SELF\IfcElementarySurface.Position.Location_ defines a point on the axis of the cylindrical surface.
* _SELF\IfcElementarySurface.Position.P[3]_ defines the direction of the axis of the cylindrical surface.
