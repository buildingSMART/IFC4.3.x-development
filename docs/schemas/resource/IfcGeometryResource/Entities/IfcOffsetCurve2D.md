# IfcOffsetCurve2D

An _IfcOffsetCurve2D_ is a curve defined by an offset in 2D space from its _BasisCurve_.

> An offset curve 2d is a curve at a constant distance from a basis curve in two-dimensional space. This entity defines a simple plane-offset curve by offsetting by distance along the normal to basis curve in the plane of basis curve. The underlying curve shall have a well-defined tangent direction at every point. In the case of a composite curve, the transition code between each segment shall be cont same gradient or cont same gradient same curvature.
>> NOTE The offset curve 2d may differ in nature from the basis curve; the offset of a non self- intersecting curve can be self-intersecting. Care should be taken to ensure that the offset to a continuous curve does not become discontinuous.
> The offset curve 2d takes its parameterization from the basis curve. The offset curve 2d is parameterized as:

> where **T** is the unit tangent vector to the basis curve **C**(_u_) at parameter value _u_, and _d_ is distance. The underlying curve shall be two-dimensional.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **offset_curve_2d** defined in ISO 10303-42.

## Attributes

### Distance
The distance of the offset curve from the basis curve. distance may be positive, negative or zero. A positive value of distance defines an offset in the direction which is normal to the curve in the sense of an anti-clockwise rotation through 90 degrees from the tangent vector T at the given point. (This is in the direction of orthogonal complement(T).)

### SelfIntersect
An indication of whether the offset curve self-intersects; this is for information only.

## Formal Propositions

### DimIs2D
The underlying curve shall be defined in two-dimensional space.
