# IfcPcurve

The _IfcPcurve_ is a curve defined within the parameter space of its reference surface.

> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A pcurve is a curve which lies on the basis of a surface and is defined in the parameter space of that surface. The basis curve is a curve defined in the two-dimensional parametric space of a reference basis surface. Although it is defined by a curve in two dimensional space, the variables involved are _u_ and _v_, which occur in the parametric representation of the referenced surface, rather than the _x_, _y_, Cartesian coordinates. The basis curve is only defined within the parametric range of the surface.
