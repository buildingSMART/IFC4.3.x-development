# IfcPlacement

An _IfcPlacement_ is an abstract supertype of placement subtypes that define the location of an item, or an entire shape representation, and provide its orientation. All placement subtypes define right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems and do not allow mirroring.

> NOTE  Cartesian transformations including mirroring and scaling are supported by _IfcCartesianTransformationOperator_

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A placement locates a geometric item with respect to the coordinate system of its geometric context. It locates the item to be defined and, in the case of the axis placement subtypes, gives its orientation.

> NOTE  Entity adapted from **placement** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.0
