# IfcPolyline

The _IfcPolyline_ is a bounded curve with only linear segments defined by a list of Cartesian points. If the first and the last Cartesian point in the list are identical, then the polyline is a closed curve, otherwise it is an open curve.

> EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates a bounded _IfcPolyline_ and shows the parametric length of each segment and of the total polyline.

> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A polyline is a bounded curve of _n_ - 1 linear segments, defined by a list of _n_ points, P~1~, P~2~ ... P~n~. The _i_th segment of the curve is parameterized as follows:
