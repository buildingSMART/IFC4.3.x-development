## Attributes

### WeightsData
The weights associated with the control points in the rational case.

### Weights
Array (two-dimensional) of weight values constructed from the _WeightsData_.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrespondingWeightsDataLists
The array dimensions for the weights shall be consistent with the control points data.

### WeightValuesGreaterZero
The weight value associated with each control point shall be greater than zero.
