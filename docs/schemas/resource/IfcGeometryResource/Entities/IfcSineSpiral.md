# IfcSineSpiral

*IfcSineSpiral* is a type of spiral curve for which the curvature change is dependent on the sine function.
<!-- end of short definition -->
The sine spiral curve is parameterized by its curve length and for a given parameter $s$, the heading angle $\theta(s)$ and the curvature $\kappa(s)$are defined as follows. Here, $A_0$ corresponds to the *ConstantTerm*, $A_1$ to the *LinearTerm*, and $A_2$ to the *SineTerm*.

**Heading Angle:**

The *Heading Angle* $\theta(s)$ represents the orientation of the tangent to the curve at a given arc length. It indicates the direction in which the curve is "pointing" at that point. By following changes in $\theta(s)$ along the curve, one can understand how the curve rotates and changes direction as it progresses.


$$\theta(s) = \frac{1}{A_0} s \;+\; \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{A_1}{|A_1|}\right)\left(\frac{s}{|A_1|}\right)^2\;-\; \frac{L}{2\pi A_2}\biggl(\cos\bigl(\frac{2\pi}{L}s\bigr)-1\biggr)$$

**Curvature:**

The *Curvature* $\kappa(s)$ describes how quickly the heading angle changes with respect to the arc length. In other words, curvature indicates how "tight" a curve is turning at any point. A larger curvature corresponds to a sharper bend, while a smaller curvature corresponds to a straighter segment of the curve.

$$  \kappa(s) = \frac{L}{A_0} \;+\; \frac{A_1}{|A_1|}\left(\frac{L}{|A_1|}\right)^2  \frac{s}{L} \;+\; \frac{L}{A_2}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{L}s\right) $$
