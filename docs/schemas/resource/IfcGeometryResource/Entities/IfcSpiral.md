# IfcSpiral

Spirals are curves that revolve around a point while increasing its length. In general, these curves are parameterized in the following way:<!-- end of definition -->
x = r(φ) cosφ
y = r(φ) sinφ

In the case of the clothoid and higher order transition spirals, the parametrization is:
x = ∫cos &Theta dl
y = ∫sin &Theta dl

where &Theta is the deflection or bearing angle and dl the differential of the spiral length.
