# IfcSurface

An _IfcSurface_ is a 2-dimensional representation item positioned in 3-dimensional space. 2-dimensional means that each point at the surface can be defined by a 2-dimensional coordinate system, usually by u and v coordinates.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A surface can be envisioned as a set of connected points in 3-dimensional space which is always locally 2-dimensional, but need not be a manifold.

> NOTE  Entity adapted from **surface** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC1.5
