# IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion

The _IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion_ is a surface derived by sweeping a curve along a vector.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> This surface is a simple swept surface or a generalized cylinder obtained by sweeping a curve in a given direction. The parameterization is as follows where the curve has a parameterization &lambda;(_u_):

>  The parameterization range for _v_ is -&infin; < _v_ < &infin; and for _u_ it is defined by the curve parameterization.

> NOTE  Entity adapted from **surface_of_linear_extrusion** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x.
