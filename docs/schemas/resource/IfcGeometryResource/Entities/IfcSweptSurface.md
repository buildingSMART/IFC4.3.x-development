# IfcSweptSurface

An _IfcSweptSurface_ is a surface defined by sweeping a curve. The swept surface is defined by a open or closed curve, represented by a subtype if _IfcProfileDef_, that is provided as a two-dimensional curve on an implicit plane, and by the sweeping operation.

* The swept curve is defined by positioning the profile in the xy plane of the object coordinate system,
* The sweeping operation is applied to the swept curve as defined within the subtypes of _IfcSweptSurface_;

The optional _Positio_n coordinate system allows for re-positioning the resulting swept surface relative to the object coordinate system.

## Attributes

### SweptCurve
The curve to be swept in defining the surface. The curve is defined as a profile within the position coordinate system.

### Position
Position coordinate system for the swept surface, provided by a profile definition within the XY plane of the _Position_ coordinates. If not provided, the position of the profile being swept is determined by the object coordinate system. In this case, the swept surface is not repositioned.
