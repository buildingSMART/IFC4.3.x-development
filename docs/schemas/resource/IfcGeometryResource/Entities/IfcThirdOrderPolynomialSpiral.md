# IfcThirdOrderPolynomialSpiral

The _IfcThirdOrderPolynomialSpiral_ is a specialization of _IfcSpiral_. The curvature _κ_ and radius of the curvature _ρ_, at any point of the curve, are related to the arc length _s_ by the third order formulae:

## Attributes

### CubicTerm
The constant that defines the cubic term in the equation which defines the relation between curvature and arc length for the curve.

### QuadraticTerm
The constant that defines the quadratic term in the equation which defines the relation between curvature and arc length for the curve.

### LinearTerm
The constant that defines the linear term in the equation which defines the relation between curvature and arc length for the curve.

### ConstantTerm
The constant that defines the constant term in the equation which defines the relation between curvature and arc length for the curve.
