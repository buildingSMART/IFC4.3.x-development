The _IfcTransitionCode_ indicated the continuity between consecutive segments of a curve or surface.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; In ContSameGradient the tangent vectors of successive segments will have the same direction, but may have different magnitude.

Figure 1 illustrates transition types

> This type conveys the continuity properties of a composite curve or surface. The continuity referred to is geometric, not parametric continuity.

> NOTE&nbsp; Type adapted from **transition_code** defined in ISO 10303-42.
