> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> This function returns the sum of the input arguments as (Arg1 - Arg2). The function returns as a vector the vector difference of the two input vectors. The input arguments shall both be of the same dimensionality but may be either directions or vectors. If both input arguments are vectors they must be expressed in the same units, if both are directions a unitless result is produced. A zero sum vector produces a vector of zero magnitude. If both input arguments are directions the result is unitless.

> NOTE Function adapted from **vector_sum** defined in ISO 10303-42.
