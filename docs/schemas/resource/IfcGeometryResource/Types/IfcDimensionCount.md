The _IfcDimensionCount_ defins the dimensionality of the coordinate space. It is restricted to have the dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 for the purpose of this specification.

> NOTE&nbsp; The shape representations assigned to a geometric representation context may include geometric representation items of lower dimensionality, particularly when defining the boundary of planar surfaces as 2D cross sections for the purpose of 3D swept areas.
