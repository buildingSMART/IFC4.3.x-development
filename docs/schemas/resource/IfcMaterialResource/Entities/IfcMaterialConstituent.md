# IfcMaterialConstituent

_IfcMaterialConstituent_ is a single and identifiable part of an element which is constructed of a number of part (one or more) each having an individual material.

In order to identify and distinguish the part of the shape representation to which the material constituent applies the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ of the element has to include instances of _IfcShapeAspect_, using the same keyword for their _Name_ attribute.

> NOTE  See the "Material Use Definition" at the individual element to which an _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ may apply for a required or recommended definition of such keywords as value for _IfcMaterialConstituent.Name_.
