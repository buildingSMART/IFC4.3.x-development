# IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage

_IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ determines the usage of _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ in terms of its location relative to the associated element geometry. The location of a material profile set shall be compatible with the building element geometry (that is, material profiles shall fit inside the element geometry). The rules to ensure the compatibility depend on the type of the building element. For building elements with shape representations which are based on extruded solids, this is accomplished by referring to the identical profile definition in the shape model as in the material profile set.

> NOTE Model view definitions or implementer agreements may provide more instructions on matching between building element geometry and material profile set usage.

> NOTE The referenced _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ may represent a single material profile, or a composite profile with two or more material profiles.

## Attributes

### ForProfileSet
The _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ set to which the usage is applied.

### CardinalPoint
Index reference to a significant point in the section profile. Describes how the section is aligned relative to the (longitudinal) axis of the member it is associated with. This parametric specification of profile alignment can be provided redundantly to the explicit alignment defined by ForProfileSet.MaterialProfiles[\*].Profile.

### ReferenceExtent
Extent of the extrusion of the elements body shape representation to which the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ applies. It is used as the reference value for the upper _OffsetValues[2]_ provided by the _IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ subtype for included material profiles.

> NOTE The attribute _ReferenceExtent_ shall be asserted if an _IfcMaterialProfileWithOffsets_ is included in the _ForProfileSet.MaterialProfiles_ list of material layers.

> NOTE The _ReferenceExtent_ for _IfcBeam_, _IfcColumn_, and _IfcMember_ is the reference length starting at z=0 being the XY plane of the object coordinate system.
