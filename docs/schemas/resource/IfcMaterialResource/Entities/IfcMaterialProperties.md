# IfcMaterialProperties

The _IfcMaterialProperties_ assigns a set of material properties to associated material definitions. The set may be identified by a _Name_ and a _Description_. The _IfcProperty_ (instantiable subtypes) is used to express the individual material properties by name, description, value and unit.<!-- end of definition -->

> NOTE The set of material properties can be assigned to an individual _IfcMaterial_, a set or composite of materials (_IfcMaterialConstituent_, _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_), or set or individual material layer (_IfcMaterialLayer_, _IfcMaterialLayerSet_), or a set or individual material profile (_IfcMaterialProfile_, _IfcMaterialProfileSet_)
