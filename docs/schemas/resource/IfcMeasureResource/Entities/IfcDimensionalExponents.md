# IfcDimensionalExponents

{ .extDef}
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-41:1992
> The dimensionality of any quantity can be expressed as a product of powers of the dimensions of base quantities. The dimensional exponents entity defines the powers of the dimensions of the base quantities. All the physical quantities are founded on seven base quantities (ISO 31 (clause 2)).

> NOTE Length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity are the seven base quantities.

> EXAMPLE A length of 2 millimetres has a length exponent of 1. The remaining exponents are equal to 0.

> EXAMPLE A velocity of 2 millimetres per second has a length exponent of 1 and a time exponent of -1. The remaining exponents are equal to 0.

> NOTE Corresponding STEP name: dimensional_exponents, please refer to ISO/IS 10303-41 for the final definition of the formal standard.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5.1.
