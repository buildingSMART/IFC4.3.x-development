# IfcComplexNumber

_IfcComplexNumber_ is a representation of a complex number expressed as an array with two elements. The first element (index 1) denotes the real component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose square roots can be calculated explicitly. The second element (index 2) denotes the imaginary component which is the numerical component of a complex number whose square roots cannot be determined other than through the provision of the square of the imaginary number j where j\^2 = -1. Note that the imaginary component may be referred to as i in certain references.
