# IfcInteger

_IfcInteger_ is a defined type of simple data type Integer. It is required since a select type (_IfcSimpleValue_) cannot include directly simple types in its select list.<!-- end of definition -->

In principle, the domain of _IfcInteger_ (being an Integer) is all integer numbers. Here the number of bits used for the _IfcInteger_ representation is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.
