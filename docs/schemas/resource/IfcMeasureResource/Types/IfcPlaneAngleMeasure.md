# IfcPlaneAngleMeasure

An _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_ is the value of an angle in a plane.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Usually measured in radian (rad, m/m = 1), but also grads may be used. The grad unit has to be declared as a conversion based unit based on radian unit.

> NOTE _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_ is used where angles need to be described to an accuracy of less than one degree and expressed as decimal parts of an angle. It is widely used for angular measurement except for situations where accuracy needs to be defined using arc measurement; for which purpose the _IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure_ is provided.

Type: REAL

> NOTE Type adapted from **plane_angle_measure** defined in ISO 10303-41.

> HISTORY New type in IFC1.5.1.
