# IfcPositiveInteger

_IfcPositiveInteger_ is a defined type based on simple data type Integer with the additional restriction to positive integers (excluding zero).
<!-- end of short definition -->

In principle, the domain of _IfcInteger_ is all integer numbers larger than zero. Here the number of bits used for the _IfcInteger_ representation is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.
