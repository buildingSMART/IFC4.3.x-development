# IfcReal

_IfcReal_ is a defined type of simple data type REAL. It is required since a select type (_IfcSimpleValue_), cannot directly include simple types in its select list.<!-- end of definition -->

In principle, the domain of _IfcReal_ (being a Real) is all rational, irrational and scientific real numbers. Here the precision is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.

Type: REAL

> HISTORY New type in IFC1.5.1.
