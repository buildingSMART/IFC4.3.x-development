# IfcColourRgbList

The _IfcColourRgbList_ defines an ordered collection of RGB colour values. Each colour value is a fixed list of three colour components (red, green, blue). The attribute _ColourList_ is a two-dimensional list, where:

* first dimension is an unbounded list representing each colour value;
* second dimension is a fixed list of three list members, where [1] is the red component, [2] the green component, and [3] the blue component.

> NOTE The _IfcColourRgbList_ is introduced to provide a compact representation of an indexable representation of colours for tessellated items.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

## Attributes

### ColourList
List of colours defined by the red, green, blue components. All values are provided as a ratio of 0.0 ≤ _value_ ≤ 1.0. When using 8bit for each colour channel, a value of 0.0 equals 0, a value of 1.0 equals 255, and values in between are interpolated.
