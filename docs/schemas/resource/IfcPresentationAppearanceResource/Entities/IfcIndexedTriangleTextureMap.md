# IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap

The _IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap_ provides the mapping of the 2-dimensional texture coordinates to the surface onto which it is mapped. It is used for mapping the texture to triangles of the _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_.

The _IfcIndexedTriangleTextureMap_ defines an index into an indexed list of texture coordinates. The _TexCoordIndex_ is a two-dimensional list, where

* first dimension is the unbounded list of faces corresponding to the list of triangles defined by _CoordIndex_ at _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_;
* second dimension is the fixed list of three indices to texture vertices corresponding to the fixed list of indices to vertices at _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_

The _TexCoords_ defined at supertype _IfcIndexedTextureMap_ are a two-dimensional list of texture coordinates provided by two parameter values. Each index of the second dimension list of _TexCoordIndex_ points to a texture vertex in _TexCoords_.

Figure 1 shows the use of _IfcTriangulatedFaceSet_ with textures.
