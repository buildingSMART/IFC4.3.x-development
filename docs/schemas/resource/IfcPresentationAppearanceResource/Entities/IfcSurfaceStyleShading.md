# IfcSurfaceStyleShading

The _IfcSurfaceStyleShading_ allows for colour information and transparency used for shading and simple rendering. The surface colour is used for colouring or simple shading of the assigned surfaces and the transparency for identifying translucency, where 0.0 is completely opaque, and 1.0 is completely transparent.

## Attributes

### SurfaceColour
The colour used to render the surface. The surface colour for visualisation is defined by specifying the intensity of red, green and blue.

### Transparency
The transparency field specifies how "clear" an object is, with 1.0 being completely transparent, and 0.0 completely opaque. If not given, the value 0.0 (opaque) is assumed.
> NOTE The definition of 1 being transparent and 0 being opaque is the opposite of the definition in alpha channels, where 0.0 is completely transparent and 1.0 is completely opaque. This definition is due to upward compatibility to previous versions of this standard in different to the definition in _IfcIndexedColourMap_.
