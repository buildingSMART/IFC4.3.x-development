# IfcTextStyle

The _IfcTextStyle_ is a presentation style for annotations that place a text in model space. The _IfcTextStyle_ provides the text style for presentation information assigned to _IfcTextLiteral_'s. The style is defined by color, text font characteristics, and text box characteristics.
<!-- end of short definition -->

An _IfcTextStyle_ is instantiated with:

* _TextCharacterAppearance_: _IfcTextStyleForDefinedFont_
* _TextStyle_: _IfcTextStyleTextModel_
* _TextFontStyle_: _IfcTextStyleFontModel_

An _IfcTextStyle_ is assigned to _IfcTextLiteral_ through the _IfcStyledItem_ entity.

> NOTE Entity adopted from font properties (font-family, font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size), Color and background properties (color, background-color) and text properties (word-spacing, letter-spacing, text-decoration, text-transform, text-align, text-indent, line-height) defined in [CSS-1](../content/bibliography.htm#CSS1).
