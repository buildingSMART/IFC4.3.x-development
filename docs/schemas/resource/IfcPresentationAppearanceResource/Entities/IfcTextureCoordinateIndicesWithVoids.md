# IfcTextureCoordinateIndicesWithVoids

The _IfcTextureCoordinateIndicesWithVoids_ is a subtype of _IfcTextureCoordinateIndices_ to be used to provide texture coordinates to polygonal faces with inner loops. The two dimensional list of _TexCoordIndex_ holds the indices into the _IfcTextureVertexList_ that correspond to the list of _CoordIndex_ at _TexCoordsOf_ where:

* the first dimension corresponds to the list position of the inner loops at _IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids_ referenced by _TexCoordsOf_
* the second dimension corresponds to the list position of the vertices at the n<sup>th</sup> inner loop at _IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids_
