# IfcFontStyle

The _IfcFontStyle_ type defines whether the normal, the italic or the oblique faces within a font family shall be used. Values are:

* normal
* italic
* oblique
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to Cascading Style Sheets, level 1
> A value of 'normal' selects a font that is classified as 'normal' in the user agents font database, while 'oblique' selects a font that is labeled 'oblique'. A value of 'italic' selects a font that is labeled 'italic', or, if that is not available, one labeled 'oblique'. The font that is labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database may actually have been generated by electronically slanting a normal font. Fonts with Oblique, Slanted or Incline in their names will typically be labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database. Fonts with _Italic, Cursive_ or _Kursiv_ in their names will typically be labeled 'italic'.

> NOTE Type adopted from **font-style** defined in [CSS-1](../content/bibliography.htm#CSS1).

> HISTORY New type in IFC2x3.
