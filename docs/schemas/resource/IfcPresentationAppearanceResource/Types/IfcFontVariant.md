# IfcFontVariant

The _IfcFontVariant_ type defines whether the normal or the small-caps faces within a font family shall be used. Values are:

* normal
* small-caps
<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to Cascading Style Sheets, level 1
> Another type of variation within a font family is the small-caps. In a small-caps font the lower case letters look similar to the uppercase ones, but in a smaller size and with slightly different proportions. The 'font-variant' property selects that font. A value of 'normal' selects a font that is not a small-caps font, 'small-caps' selects a small-caps font. It is acceptable (but not required) in CSS1 if the small-caps font is a created by taking a normal font and replacing the lower case letters by scaled uppercase characters. As a last resort, uppercase letters will be used as replacement for a small-caps font.

> NOTE Type adopted from **font-variant** defined in [CSS-1](../content/bibliography.htm#CSS1).

> HISTORY New type in IFC2x3.
