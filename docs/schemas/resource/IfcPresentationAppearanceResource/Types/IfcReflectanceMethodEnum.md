### GLASS
A reflectance model that supports an approximation of glass-like materials that have both reflective and transmissive properties.

### MATT
A reflectance model providing a dull matte appearance.

### METAL
A reflectance model providing a specular metallic appearance.

### MIRROR
A reflectance model that supports secondary mirrored views through ray tracing.

### PHONG
A reflectance model conforming with the Phong lighting model defined in X3D.

### PLASTIC
A reflectance model providing a specular effect which is similar to the Phong model.

### STRAUSS
