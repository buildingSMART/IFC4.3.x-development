# IfcReflectanceMethodEnum

The _IfcReflectanceMethodEnum_ defines the range of different reflectance methods available.

> HISTORY  New enumeration type in IFC2x2.

## Items

### BLINN
A reflectance model providing a smooth, slightly shiny appearance.

### FLAT
A reflectance model providing a constant colour. This model ignores the effect of all light sources.

### GLASS
A reflectance model that supports an approximation of glass-like materials that have both reflective and transmissive properties.

### MATT
A reflectance model providing a dull matte appearance.

### METAL
A reflectance model providing a specular metallic appearance.

### MIRROR
A reflectance model that supports secondary mirrored views through ray tracing.

### PHONG
A reflectance model conforming with the Phong model in which reflections are greatest in the mirror direction of a surface opposite the viewing direction with respect to the surface normal.

### PLASTIC
A reflectance model providing a specular effect which is similar to the Phong model.

### STRAUSS
A reflectance model for metallic and non-metallic appearance based on a limited set of control parameter.

### PHYSICAL
Physical.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined.
