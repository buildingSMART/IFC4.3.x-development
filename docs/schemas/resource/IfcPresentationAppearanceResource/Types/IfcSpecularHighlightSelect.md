# IfcSpecularHighlightSelect

The _IfcSpecularHighlightSelect_ defines the selectable types of value for specular highlight sharpness.

> NOTE&nbsp; The two select types relate to the different ways to specifiy the sharpness (or shininess) of the specular part of the reflectance equation. For each surface side style only one of the two methods is needed for calculating the specular part of the equation.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New select type in IFC2x2.
