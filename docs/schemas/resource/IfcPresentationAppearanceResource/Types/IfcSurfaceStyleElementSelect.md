# IfcSurfaceStyleElementSelect

The _IfcSurfaceStyleElementSelect_ provides a selection between different surface styles, including _IfcSurfaceStyleRendering_ for rendering properties, _IfcSurfaceStyleLighting_, which holds the exact physically based lighting properties for lighting based calculation algorithms (as the opposite to the rendering based calculation), the _IfcSurfaceStyleRefraction_ (for more advanced refraction indices) and _IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures_ to allow for image textures applied to surfaces. In addition an _IfcExternallyDefinedSurfaceStyle_ can be selected that points into an external rendering material library.<!-- end of definition -->

> NOTE The _IfcSurfaceStyleLighting_ are needed for exact lighting calculation, because physically based lighting calculation algorithms need exact physically based parameters. The factors in _IfcSurfaceStyleRendering_ lack the physical base, they are intended for rendering calculations, but a lighting calculation based software cannot use these values.
