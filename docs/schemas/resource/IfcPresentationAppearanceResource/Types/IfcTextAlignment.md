# IfcTextAlignment

The _IfcTextAlignment_ describes how text is aligned within the element. Values are:

* left
* right
* center
* justify

<!-- end of short definition -->

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to Cascading Style Sheets, level 1
> The actual justification algorithm used is user agent and human language dependent. If 'justify' is not supported, the user agent will supply a replacement. Typically, this will be 'left' for western languages.

> NOTE Type adopted from **text-align** defined in [CSS-1](../content/bibliography.htm#CSS1).

> HISTORY New type in IFC2x3.
