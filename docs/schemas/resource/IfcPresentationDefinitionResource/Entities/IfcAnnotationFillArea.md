# IfcAnnotationFillArea

The _IfcAnnotationFillArea_ defines an area by a definite _OuterBoundary_, that might include _InnerBoundaries_. The areas defined by the _InnerBoundaries_ are excluded from applying the fill area style. The _InnerBoundaries_ shall not intersect with the _OuterBoundary_ nor being outside of the _OuterBoundary_.<!-- end of definition -->

The fill area style that is applied to the _IfcAnnotationFillArea_ is declared using the _IfcFillAreaStyle_, associated to the area by an _IfcStyledItem_. Applicable fill area styles are a solid color, a hatching, tiles, or a combination of those styles.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE Definition according to ISO 10303-46:
> An annotation fill area is a set of curves that may be filled with hatching, colour or tiling. The annotation fill are is described by boundaries which consist of non-intersecting, non-self-intersecting closed curves. These curves form the boundary of planar areas to be filled according to the style for the annotation fill area.

> NOTE Entity adapted from **annotation_fill_area** defined in ISO10303-46

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE The two attributes _OuterBoundary_ and _InnerBoundaries_ are added and replace the previous single boundary.

**Informal Propositions**

1. Any curve that describes an inner boundary shall not intersect with, nor include, another curve defining an inner boundary.
2. The curve defining the outer boundary shall not intersect with any curve defining an inner boundary, nor shall it be surrounded by a curve defining an inner boundary.

## Attributes

### OuterBoundary
A closed curve that defines the outer boundary of the fill area. The areas defined by the outer boundary (minus potentially defined inner boundaries) is filled by the fill area style.
{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE The two new attributes _OuterBoundary_ and _InnerBoundaries_ replace the old single attribute Boundaries.

### InnerBoundaries
A set of inner curves that define the inner boundaries of the fill area. The areas defined by the inner boundaries are excluded from applying the fill area style.
