# IfcPlanarBox

A planar box specifies an arbitrary rectangular box and its location in a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. If the planar box is used within a three-dimensional coordinate system, it defines the rectangular box within the XY plane.<!-- end of definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

## Attributes

### Placement
The _IfcAxis2Placement_ positions a local coordinate system for the definition of the rectangle. The origin of this local coordinate system serves as the lower left corner of the rectangular box.

> NOTE In case of a 3D placement by _IfcAxis2Placement3D the _IfcPlanarBox_ is defined within the xy plane of the definition coordinate system._
