# IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef

The closed profile _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ defines an arbitrary two-dimensional profile for the use within the swept surface geometry, the swept area solid or a sectioned spine. It is given by an outer boundary from which the surface or solid can be constructed.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5. Entity has been renamed from _IfcArbitraryProfileDef_ in IFC2x.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The _OuterCurve_ has to be a closed curve.
2. The _OuterCurve_ shall not intersect.

Figure 1 illustrates the arbitrary closed profile definition. The _OuterCurve_ is defined in the underlying coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of either:

* IfcSweptSurface.Position
* IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position

or in case of sectioned spines the xy plane of each list member of _IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions_. The _OuterCurve_ attribute defines a two dimensional closed bounded curve.

## Attributes

### OuterCurve
Bounded curve, defining the outer boundaries of the arbitrary profile.

## Formal Propositions

### WR1
The curve used for the outer curve definition shall have the dimensionality of 2.

### WR2
The outer curve shall not be of type IfcLine as IfcLine is not a closed curve.

### WR3
The outer curve shall not be of type IfcOffsetCurve2D as it should not be defined as an offset of another curve.
