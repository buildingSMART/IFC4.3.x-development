# IfcAsymmetricIShapeProfileDef

_IfcAsymmetricIShapeProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a singly symmetric I-shaped section. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration. The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profile's centre of the bounding box.<!-- end of definition -->

The overall width of the profile is implicitly given by the maximum of the bottom flange width and the top flange width.

_IfcAsymmetricIShapeProfileDef_ can also be used to model rail profiles if the application scenario does not require a full explicit shape model of the rail profile. Alternatively, _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ can be used to provide the exact shape of rail profiles. Either way, a reference to an external document or library should be provided to further define the profile as described at _IfcProfileDef_.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE All profile origins are now in the center of the bounding box. The attribute _CentreOfGravityInY_ has been made OPTIONAL.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE Supertype changed from _IfcIShapeProfileDef_ to _IfcParameterizedProfileDef_. Attributes which were inherited from _IfcIShapeProfileDef_ are now defined directly at _IfcAsymmetricIShapeProfileDef_ and have been partially renamed but were not reordered.
> Bottom flange may be narrower than top flange.
> Type of _TopFlangeFilletRadius_ relaxed to allow for zero radius.
> Trailing attribute _CentreOfGravityInY_ deleted, use respective property in _IfcProfileProperties_ instead.
> Attributes _BottomFlangeEdgeRadius_, _BottomFlangeSlope_, _TopFlangeEdgeRadius_, _TopFlangeSlope_ added.

Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the asymmetric I-shaped section definition. The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

* _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile. The parameterized profile is defined by a set of parameter attributes. In the illustrated example, the 'CentreOfGravityInY' property in _IfcProfileProperties_, if provided, is negative.

## Attributes

### BottomFlangeWidth
Extent of the bottom flange, defined parallel to the x axis of the position coordinate system.

### OverallDepth
Total extent of the depth, defined parallel to the y axis of the position coordinate system.

### WebThickness
Thickness of the web of the I-shape. The web is centred on the x-axis and the y-axis of the position coordinate system.

### BottomFlangeThickness
Flange thickness of the bottom flange.

### BottomFlangeFilletRadius
The fillet between the web and the bottom flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.

### TopFlangeWidth
Extent of the top flange, defined parallel to the x axis of the position coordinate system.

### TopFlangeThickness
Flange thickness of the top flange. This attribute is formally optional for historic reasons only. Whenever the flange thickness is known, it shall be provided by value.

### TopFlangeFilletRadius
The fillet between the web and the top flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.

### BottomFlangeEdgeRadius
Radius of the upper edges of the bottom flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.

### BottomFlangeSlope
Slope of the upper faces of the bottom flange. Non-zero in case of of tapered bottom flange, 0 in case of parallel bottom flange, omitted if unknown.

### TopFlangeEdgeRadius
Radius of the lower edges of the top flange. 0 if sharp-edged, omitted if unknown.

### TopFlangeSlope
Slope of the lower faces of the top flange. Non-zero in case of of tapered top flange, 0 in case of parallel top flange, omitted if unknown.

## Formal Propositions

### ValidFlangeThickness
The sum of flange thicknesses shall be less than the overall depth.

### ValidWebThickness
The web thickness shall be less than either flange width.

### ValidBottomFilletRadius
The bottom fillet radius, if given, shall be within the range of allowed values.

### ValidTopFilletRadius
The top fillet radius, if given, shall be within the range of allowed values.
