# IfcCircleHollowProfileDef

_IfcCircleHollowProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a circular hollow section (tube) to be used by the swept area solid. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration.The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profile's centre of the bounding box (for symmetric profiles identical with the centre of gravity).<!-- end of definition -->

Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the circular hollow profile definition. The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

* _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile. Explicit coordinate offsets are used to define cardinal points (for example, upper-left bound). The parameterized profile is defined by a set of parameter attributes.

## Attributes

### WallThickness
Thickness of the material, it is the difference between the outer and inner radius.

## Formal Propositions

### WR1
The wall thickness shall be smaller then the radius.
