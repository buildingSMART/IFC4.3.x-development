# IfcRectangleHollowProfileDef

_IfcRectangleHollowProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a rectangular (or square) hollow section to be used by the swept surface geometry or the swept area solid. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration. A square hollow section can be defined by equal values for h and b. The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profiles centre of the bounding box (for symmetric profiles identical with the centre of gravity). Normally, the longer sides are parallel to the y-axis, the shorter sides parallel to the x-axis.

<u>Position</u>

The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

 * IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position

by using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile.

## Attributes
