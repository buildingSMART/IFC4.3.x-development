# IfcRectangleProfileDef

_IfcRectangleProfileDef_ defines a rectangle as the profile definition used by the swept surface geometry or the swept area solid. It is given by its X extent and its Y extent, and placed within the 2D position coordinate system, established by the _Position_ attribute. It is placed centric within the position coordinate system.

Figure 1 â€” Rectangle profile

<u>Position</u>

The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system.
The underlying
coordinate system is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid
that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of either: </p>

 * IfcSweptSurface.Position
 * IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position

or in case of sectioned spines the xy plane of each list member of IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions.

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile
can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position
relative to the profile. Explicit coordinate offsets are used to define
cardinal points (for example, upper-left bound).

<u>Parameter</u>

The <em>IfcRectangleProfileDef</em> is defined within the position coordinate system, where the <em>XDim</em> defines the length measure for the length of the rectangle (half along the positive x-axis) and the <em>YDim</em> defines the length measure for the width of the rectangle (half along the positive y-axis).


## Attributes

### XDim
The extent of the rectangle in the direction of the x-axis.

### YDim
The extent of the rectangle in the direction of the y-axis.
