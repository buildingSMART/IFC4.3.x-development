_IfcRoundedRectangleProfileDef_ defines a rectangle with equally rounded corners as the profile definition used by the swept surface geometry or the swept area solid. It is given by the X extent, the Y extent, and the radius for the rounded corners, and placed within the 2D position coordinate system, established by the _Position_ attribute. It is placed centric within the position coordinate system, that is, in the center of the bounding box.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x}
> IFC2x CHANGE The _IfcRoundedRectangleProfileDef_ is now subtyped from _IfcRectangleProfileDef_. The _XDim_ and _YDim_ attributes have been removed (now inherited from supertype).

Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the rounded rectangle profile definition.

Figure 1 — Rounded rectangle profile

<u>Position</u>

The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept surface or swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of either:

 * IfcSweptSurface.Position
 * IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position

or in case of sectioned spines the xy plane of each list member of IfcSectionedSpine.CrossSectionPositions.

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile. Explicit coordinate offsets are used to define cardinal points (e.g. upper-left bound).

<u>Parameter</u>

The <em>IfcRoundedRectangleProfileDef</em> is defined within the position coordinate system, where the <em>XDim</em> defines the measure for the length of the rectangle (half along the positive x-axis), the <em>YDim</em> defines the length measure for the width of the rectangle (half along the positive y-axis) and the <em>RoundingRadius</em> defines the radius of curvature in all four corners of the rectangle.

## Attributes

### RoundingRadius
Radius of the circular arcs by which all four corners of the rectangle are equally rounded.

## Formal Propositions

### ValidRadius
The value of the attribute RoundingRadius shall be lower or equal than either of both, half the value of the Xdim and the YDim attribute.
