# IfcZShapeProfileDef

_IfcZShapeProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a Z-shape section to be used by the swept area solid. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration. The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profile's centre of the bounding box.

> IFC4 CHANGE Type of _FilletRadius_ and _EdgeRadius_ relaxed to allow for zero radius.

Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the Z-shape profile definition.

Figure 1 â€” Z-shape profile

<u>Position</u>

The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system.
The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid
that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

 * IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile
can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position
relative to the profile.
