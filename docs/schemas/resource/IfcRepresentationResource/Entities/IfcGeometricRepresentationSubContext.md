# IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext

_IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ defines the context that applies to several shape representations of a product being a sub context, sharing the _WorldCoordinateSystem_, _CoordinateSpaceDimension_, _Precision_ and _TrueNorth_ attributes with the parent _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ is used to define semantically distinguished representation types for different information content, dependent on the representation view and the target scale. It can be used to control the level of detail of the shape representation that is most applicable to this geometric representation context. In addition the sub context is used to control the later appearance of the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ within a plot view.

> NOTE If the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ using this sub context has_IfcStyledItem_'s assigned to the _Items_, the presentation style information (e.g. _IfcCurveStyle_, _IfcTextStyle_) associated with the _IfcStyledItem_ is given in target plot dimensions. For example, a line thickness (_IfcCurveStyle.CurveWidth_) is given by a thickness measure relating to the thickness for a plot within the (range of) target scale.

Each _IfcProduct_ can then have several instances of subtypes of _IfcRepresentation_, each being assigned to a different _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_). The applicable values for the inherited _ContextIdentifier_ attribute shall be identical to the _RepresentationIdentifier_ attribute defined at _IfcShapeRepresentation_.

> NOTE The provision of a model view (_IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.ContextType_ = 'Model') is mandatory. Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ relate to it as its _ParentContext_.

> EXAMPLE Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ can be used to handle the multi-view blocks or macros, which are used in CAD programs to store several scale and/or view dependent geometric representations of the same object. The application can then choose the most appropriate representation for showing the geometric shape of the product, depending on the target view and scale.

## Attributes

### ParentContext
Parent context from which the sub context derives its world coordinate system, precision, space coordinate dimension and true north.

### TargetScale
The target <font color="#ff0000">plot</font> scale of the representation
to which this representation context applies.
> NOTE Scale indicates the target plot scale for the representation sub context, all annotation styles are given in plot dimensions according to this target plot scale.
> If multiple instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ are given having the same _TargetView_ value, the target plot scale applies up to the next smaller scale, or up to unlimited small scale.

> NOTE Scale 1:100 (given as 0.01 within _TargetScale_) is bigger then 1:200 (given as 0.005 within _TargetScale_).

### TargetView
Target view of the representation to which this representation context applies.

### UserDefinedTargetView
User defined target view, this attribute value shall be given, if the TargetView attribute is set to USERDEFINED.

### WorldCoordinateSystem


### CoordinateSpaceDimension


### TrueNorth


### Precision


## Formal Propositions

### ParentNoSub
The parent context shall not be another geometric representation sub context.

### UserTargetProvided
The attribute _UserDefinedTargetView_ shall be given, if the attribute _TargetView_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### NoCoordOperation
An _IfcCoordinateOperation_ shall not be provided to a geometric representation sub context, only to the parent geometric representation context.
> NOTE The coordinate operation is used to define the coordinate transformation of the project engineering coordinate system to a geographic coordinate reference system.
