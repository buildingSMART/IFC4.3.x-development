# IfcMapConversion

The map conversion deals with transforming the local engineering coordinate system, often called world coordinate system, into the coordinate reference system of the underlying map.
<!-- end of short definition -->

> NOTE The _IfcMapConversion_ does not handle the projection of a map from the geodetic coordinate reference system.

For this transformation, _IfcMapConversion_ data are used for:
1. a scaling of the three axes (x,y,z), by the same _IfcMapConversion.Scale_
2. followed by an **anti-clockwise** rotation about the z-axis of *θ*, where:

$$
\theta=arctan\left(\frac{XAxisOrdinate}{XAxisAbscissa}\right)
$$

3. and then a translation in (x,y,z) of _IfcMapConversion.Eastings_, _IfcMapConversion.Northings_, _IfcMapConversion.OrthogonalHeight_

With _IfcMapConversion_, **one scale** is applied equally to x, y and z, **to convert units**.
With _IfcMapConversionScaled_, additional **different factors** multiply x, y and z, to **scale coordinates** - not units.

> NOTE The z-axis of the local engineering coordinate system is always parallel to the z-axis of the map coordinate system.

> NOTE The *Scale* can be used when the length unit for the 3 axes of the map coordinate system are not identical with the length unit established for this project (see _IfcProject.UnitsInContext_) - for example to convert feet into metres. If omitted, the scale factor 1.0 is assumed.

## Attributes

### Eastings
Specifies the location along the easting of the coordinate system of the target map coordinate reference system.
> NOTE for right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems this would establish the location along the x axis.

### Northings
Specifies the location along the northing of the coordinate system of the target map coordinate reference system.
> NOTE for right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems this would establish the location along the y axis

### OrthogonalHeight
Orthogonal height relative to the vertical datum specified.
> NOTE for right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems this would establish the location along the z axis

### XAxisAbscissa
Specifies the value along the easting axis of the end point of a vector indicating the position of the local x axis of the engineering coordinate reference system.
> NOTE for right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems this would establish the location along the x axis

> NOTE together with the _XAxisOrdinate_ it provides the direction of the local x axis within the horizontal plane of the map coordinate system

### XAxisOrdinate
Specifies the value along the northing axis of the end point of a vector indicating the position of the local x axis of the engineering coordinate reference system.
> NOTE for right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems this would establish the location along the y axis

_XAxisAbscissa_ it provides the direction of the local x axis within the horizontal plane of the map coordinate system.

### Scale
Scale to be used, when the units of the CRS are not identical to the units of the engineering coordinate system. If omitted, the value of 1.0 is assumed.
