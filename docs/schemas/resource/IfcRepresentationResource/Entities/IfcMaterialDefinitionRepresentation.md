# IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation

_IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_ defines presentation information relating to _IfcMaterial_. It allows for multiple presentations of the same material for different geometric representation contexts.

> NOTE  The _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_ is currently only used to define presentation information to material used at element occurrences, defined as subtypes of _IfcElement_, or at element types, defined as subtypes of _IfcElementType_. The _IfcMaterial_ is assigned to the subtype of _IfcElement_, or _IfcElementType_ using the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship (eventually via other material related entities _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, _IfcMaterialLayer_, or _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_, _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, _IfcMaterialProfile_).

The _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_ can apply

* different presentation styles for different representation contexts, for example, a different style for sketch view, model view or plan view, or for different target scales,
* for each representation context is can apply curve style, fill area style (hatching), symbol, text and surface style.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2x3.

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE  The entity _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_ has been added. Upward compatibility for file based exchange is guaranteed.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE  The assignment of curve, surface and other styles to an _IfcStyledItem_ has been simplified by _IfcStyleAssignmentSelect_. The use of intermediate _IfcPresentationStyleAssignment_ is deprecated.

Figure 1 &mdash; Material definition representation

As shown in Figure 1, the presentation assignment can be specific to a representation context by adding one and more <em>IfcStyledRepresentation</em>'s. Each of them includes a single <em>IfcStyledItem</em> with exactly zero or one style for either curve, fill area, surface, text or symbol style that is applicable.

## Attributes

### RepresentedMaterial
Reference to the material to which the representation applies.

## Formal Propositions

### OnlyStyledRepresentations
Only representations of type _IfcStyledRepresentation_ should be used to represent material through the _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_.
