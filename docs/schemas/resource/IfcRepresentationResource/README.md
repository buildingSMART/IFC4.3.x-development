IfcRepresentationResource
=========================

This schema defines the representation of shape and topology as important definitional properties for products defined within the IFC Object Model. The representations characterize certain properties of a product, and any product can be defined by zero, one, or many of those properties. The schema defines two ways to represent definitional properties of products:

* topological representation
* geometric shape representation

The geometric shape representation allows for

* multiple shape representations for the same product definition shape of a product
* separate shape representations for components or parts of the product definition shape by using shape aspects

> NOTE  The definitions within this schema have been influenced or have been adapted from ISO 10303-41, ISO 10303-42, and ISO 10303-43.
