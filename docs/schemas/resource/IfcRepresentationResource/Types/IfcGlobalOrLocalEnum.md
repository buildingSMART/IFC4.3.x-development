# IfcGlobalOrLocalEnum

This enumeration type defines if the local object coordinate system or the global world coordinate system for the project is used to describe the measure values of entities which have a reference to this type.<!-- end of definition -->

> NOTE The world coordinate system is given by the _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.WorldCoordinateSystem_ and is unique within the project. The local (or object) coordinate system is given by_IfcProduct.ObjectPlacement_ and is used by all _IfcRepresentation_'s within the _IfcProduct.Representation_.

> HISTORY New enumeration in IFC2x2.
