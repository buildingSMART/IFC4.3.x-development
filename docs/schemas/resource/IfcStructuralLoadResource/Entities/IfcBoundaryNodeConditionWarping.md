# IfcBoundaryNodeConditionWarping

Describes linearly elastic support conditions or connection conditions, including linearly elastic warping restraints.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Applicability:

* Point supports and connections.

> HISTORY New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE All attribute data types changed from numeric to SELECT between Boolean and numeric. Stiffnesses may now also be negative, for example to capture destabilizing effects in boundary conditions. The IFC2x3 convention of -1. representing infinite stiffness is no longer valid and must not be used. Infinite stiffness, i.e. fixed supports, are now modeled by the Boolean value TRUE.

## Attributes

### WarpingStiffness
Defines the warping stiffness value.
