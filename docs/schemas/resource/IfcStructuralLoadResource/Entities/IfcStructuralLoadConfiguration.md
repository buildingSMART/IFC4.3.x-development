> HISTORY New entity in IFC4.

**Informal Propositions**

1. All items in _Values_ shall be of the same type.
2. If the loads or results comprise a curve activity, 1-dimensional locations shall be given, measured locally along the curve. The location shall not exceed the bounds of the curve actvity. The load samples and corresponding locations shall be given in ascending order of locations.
3. If the loads or results comprise a surface activity, 2-dimensional locations shall be given, measured in the surface activity's local x and y directions. The location shall not exceed the bounds of the surface activity.

> NOTE There are no ordering requirements in the 2-dimensional case, but the 1-dimensional case shall be spatially ordered for simplicity.

## Attributes

### Values
List of load or result values.

### Locations
Locations of the load samples or result samples, given within the local coordinate system defined by the instance which uses this resource object. Each item in the list of locations pertains to the values list item at the same list index. This attribute is optional for configurations in which the locations are implicitly known from higher-level definitions.

## Formal Propositions

### ValidListSize
If locations are provided, there shall be as many location items as there are value items.
