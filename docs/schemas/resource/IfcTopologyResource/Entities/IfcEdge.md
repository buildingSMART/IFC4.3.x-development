# IfcEdge

An _IfcEdge_ defines two vertices being connected topologically. The geometric representation of the connection between the two vertices defaults to a straight line if no curve geometry is assigned using the subtype _IfcEdgeCurve_. The _IfcEdge_ can therefore be used to exchange straight edges without an associated geometry provided by _IfcLine_ or _IfcPolyline_ thought _IfcEdgeCurve.EdgeGeometry_.

Figure 1 — Edge representation

> EXAMPLE Figure 1 illustrates an example where the bounds of the <em>IfcEdge</em> are given by the <em>EdgeStart</em> and <em>EdgeEnd</em>; this also determines the direction of the edge. The location within a coordinate space is determined by the <em>IfcVertexPoint</em> type for <em>EdgeStart</em> and <em>EdgeEnd</em>. Since no edge geometry is assigned, it defaults to a straight line agreeing to the direction sense.

> NOTE Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> An edge is the topological construct corresponding to the connection of two vertices. More abstractly, it may stand for a logical relationship between two vertices. The domain of an edge, if present, is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in _R^M^_, that is, a connected 1-dimensional manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal direction to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the same, the edge is a self loop. The domain of the edge does not include its bounds, and 0 ≤ Ξ ≤ ∞. Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate the edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting within the domain of the edge. An edge is a graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus _G^e^_ may be determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since _M_ = _E_ = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the case to:

1. The edge has dimensionality 1.
2. The extent of an edge shall be finite and nonzero.

## Attributes

### EdgeStart
Start point (vertex) of the edge.

### EdgeEnd
End point (vertex) of the edge. The same vertex can be used for both EdgeStart and EdgeEnd.
