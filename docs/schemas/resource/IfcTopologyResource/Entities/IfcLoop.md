> A loop is a topological entity constructed from a single vertex, or by stringing together connected (oriented) edges, or linear segments beginning and ending at the same vertex. It is typically used to bound a face lying on a surface. A loop has dimensionality of 0 or 1. The domain of a 0-dimensional loop is a single point. The domain of a 1-dimensional loop is a connected, oriented curve, but need not to be manifold. As the loop is a circle, the location of its beginning/ending point is arbitrary. The domain of the loop includes its bounds, an 0 ≤ Ξ < ∞. A loop is represented by a single vertex, or by an ordered collection of oriented edges, or by an ordered collection of points. A loop is a graph, so _M_ and the graph genus _G^l^_ may be determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since _M_ = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in this case to

**Informal Propositions**

1. A loop has a finite extent.
2. A loop describes a closed (topological) curve with coincident start and end vertices.
