# IfcPolyLoop

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992
> A poly loop is a loop with straight edges bounding a planar region in space. A poly loop is a loop of genus 1 where the loop is represented by an ordered coplanar collection of points forming the vertices of the loop. The loop is composed of straight line segments joining a point in the collection to the succeeding point in the collection. The closing segment is from the last to the first point in the collection. The direction of the loop is in the direction of the line segments.

 The _IfcPolyLoop_ is always closed and the last segment is from the last _IfcCartesianPoint_ in the list of _Polygon_'s to the first _IfcCartesianPoint_. Therefore the first point shall not be repeated at the end of the list, neither by referencing the same instance, nor by using an additional instance of _IfcCartesianPoint_ having the coordinates as the first point.

Informal Propositions:

1. All the points in the polygon defining the poly loop shall be coplanar.
2. The first and the last _Polygon_ shall be different by value.

## Attributes

### Polygon
List of points defining the loop. There are no repeated points in the list.

## Formal Propositions

### AllPointsSameDim
