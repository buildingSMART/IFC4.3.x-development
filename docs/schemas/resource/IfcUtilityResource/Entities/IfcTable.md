# IfcTable

An _IfcTable_ is a data structure for the provision of information in the form of rows and columns. Each instance may have _IfcTableColumn_ instances that define the name, description and units for each column. The rows of information are stored as a list of _IfcTableRow_ objects.
<!-- end of short definition -->

Limitation: For backwards compatibility, the rows of an _IfcTable_ object are constrained to have the same number of cells. The first row of the table provides the number of cells. All other rows are forced to include the same number of cells. This is enforced by the WR2.

## Attributes

### Name


### Rows
Reference to information content of rows.

### Columns
The column information associated with this table.

### NumberOfCellsInRow
The number of cells in each row, this complies to the number of columns in a table. See WR2 that ensures that each row has the same number of cells. The actual value is derived from the first member of the Rows list.

### NumberOfHeadings
The number of headings in a table. This is restricted by WR3 to max. one.

### NumberOfDataRows
The number of rows in a table that contains data, i.e. total number of rows minus number of heading rows in table.

## Formal Propositions

### WR1
Ensures that each row defines the same number of cells. The rule compares whether all other rows of the IfcTable have the same number of cells as the first row.

### WR2
The rule restricts the allowed number of heading rows to no more than one.
