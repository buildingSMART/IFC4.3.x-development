# IfcTableColumn

An _IfcTableColumn_ is a data structure that captures column information for use in an _IfcTable_. Each instance defines the identifier, name, description, and units of measure that are applicable to the columnar data associated with the _IfcTableRow_ objects.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The use of _IfcTableColumn_ supersedes the _IsHeading_ flag associated with _IfcTableRow_.

## Attributes

### Identifier
The _Identifier_ identifies the column within the table. If provided, it must be unique within the table. Columns may be cross-referenced across multiple tables by sharing the same column identifier.

### Name
The _Name_ is a human-readable caption for the table column. It is not necessarily unique.

### Description
The _Description_ provides human-readable text describing the table column.

### Unit
The _Unit_ indicates the unit of measure to be used for this column's data. If not provided, then project default units are assumed. If _ReferencePath_ is provided, the the unit must be of the same measure as the referenced attribute.

### ReferencePath
The _ReferencePath_ indicates a relative path to the object and attribute for which data within this column is to be applied.

For constraints, such path is relative to the _IfcObjectDefinition_ associated by _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_.RelatedObjects. For a constraint to be satisfied, exactly one row of the table must match the referenced object for all columns where the _ReferencePath_ attribute is set.
