# IfcTableRow

_IfcTableRow_ contains data for a single row within an _IfcTable_.<!-- end of definition -->

Limitation: For backward compatibility, all _IfcTableRow_ objects referenced by an _IfcTable_ shall have the same number of Row Cells. The actual number of Cells shall be taken from the number of cells of the first _IfcTableRow_ for that table. The number of Cells is calculated by the derived attribute _NumberOfCellsInRow_ in the associated _IfcTable_.

> NOTE The attribute _IsHeading_ exists for backward compatibility. _IfcTableColumn_ should be used instead beginning with IFC4.

Figure 338 — Table row use alternative

Figure 338 depicts how table rows were structured prior to IFC4 with the use of the <em>IsHeading</em> flag. Note that the use of the <em>IfcTableColumn</em> constructs should be used instead of the <em>IsHeading</em> flag (which remains for backward compatibility only).

> HISTORY New entity in IFC1.5.
