# IfcBeamType

The element type _IfcBeamType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of beams. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations

It is used to define a beam specification, or beam style (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that beam type). Beam types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcBeamType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_, or its applicable subtypes.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a beam element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Profile Set

The material of the _IfcBeamType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ (see material use definition above). The _IfcMaterialProfile_ refers to the subtype of _IfcProfileDef_ that is the common profile for all beam occurrence, if used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTEÂ  The attribute _ProfileName_ of the _IfcProfileDef_ subtype, referenced in _IfcMaterialProfile_ should contain a standardized profile name according to local standards. However, an additional geometric representation of the profile is necessary (such as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_). An importing application is allowed to check for the existence of the profile name: in case of identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and possible non geometric _IfcProfileProperties_ have to be used.

### Type Body Geometry

The _IfcBeamType_ may define the shared geometric representation for all beam occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations (e.g. with _IfcShapeRepresentation_'s having an _RepresentationIdentifier_ 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It is only applicable if the _IfcBeamType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcBeam_ (See geometric use definition of _IfcBeam_ for further information).

> NOTE  If the _IfcBeamType_ has an associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, then no shared geometric representation shall be provided.

> NOTE  The product shape representations are defined as _RepresentationMaps_ (attribute of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_), which get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_. See _IfcTypeProduct_ for further information.

> NOTE  The values of attributes _RepresentationIdentifier_ and _RepresentationType_ of _IfcShapeRepresentation_ are restricted in the same way as those for _IfcBeam_
