# IfcColumnType

The element type _IfcColumnType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of columns. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations

It is used to define a column specification, or column style (i.e. the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that column type). Column types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcColumnType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcColumnStandardCase_ if the _IfcColumnType_ has a single associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_; otherwise they are represented by instances of _IfcColumn_. Occurrences of the _IfcColumnType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_, or its applicable subtypes.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a column element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Body Geometry

The IfcColumnType may define the shared geometric
representation for all column occurrences. The
RepresentationMaps attribute refers to a list of
IfcRepresentationMap's, that allow for multiple geometric
representations (e.g. with IfcShapeRepresentation's having
an RepresentationIdentifier 'Box', 'Axis', or 'Body'). It
is only applicable if the IfcColumnType has only
occurrences of type IfcColumn (See geometric use
definition of IfcColumn for further information).



> NOTE  If the IfcColumnType has an
> associated IfcMaterialProfileSet, then no shared geometric
> representation shall be provided.



> NOTE  The product shape representations are
> defined as RepresentationMaps (attribute of the supertype
> IfcTypeProduct), which get assigned by an element
> occurrence instance through the
> IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[n] being an
> IfcMappedItem. See IfcTypeProduct for further
> information.



> NOTE  The values of attributes
> RepresentationIdentifier and RepresentationType of
> IfcShapeRepresentation are restricted in the same way as
> those for IfcColumn and
> IfcColumnStandardCase



### Material Profile Set

The material of the IfcColumnType is defined by the
IfcMaterialProfileSet or as fall back by
IfcMaterial and attached by the
IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial. It is
accessible by the inverse HasAssociations
relationship.

> NOTE  It is illegal to assign an IfcMaterial to an IfcColumnType, if there is at least one occurrences of IfcColumnStandardCase for this
> type.

The shared profile definition is defined by assigning an
IfcMaterialProfileSet (see material use definition above).
The IfcMaterialProfile refers to the subtype of
IfcProfileDef that is the common profile for all column
occurrence, if used. It is only applicable if the
IfcColumnType has only occurrences of type
IfcColumnStandardCase (see definition of
IfcColumnStandardCase for further information).



>
> NOTE  The attribute ProfileName of the
> IfcProfileDef subtype, referenced in
> IfcMaterialProfile should contain a standardized profile
> name according to local standards. However, an additional
