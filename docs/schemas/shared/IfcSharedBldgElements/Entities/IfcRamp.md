# IfcRamp

A ramp is a vertical passageway which provides a human or vehicle circulation link between one floor level and another floor level at a different elevation. It may include a landing as an intermediate floor slab. A ramp normally does not include steps.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE  Definition according to ISO 6707-1: Inclined way or floor joining two surfaces at different levels.

The _IfcRamp_ shall either be represented:

* as a ramp assembly that aggregates all parts (ramp flight, landing, etc.) with own shape representations, or
* as a single ramp without decomposition including all shape representations directly at the ramp entity.

> NOTE  In case of an _IfcRamp_ being the assembly of all parts of the ramp the aggregation is handled by the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship, relating an _IfcRamp_ with the related _IfcRampFlight_ and landings, _IfcSlab_ with _PredefinedType_=LANDING. _IfcRailing_'s belonging to the ramp may also be included into the aggregation.

> NOTE  Model View Definitions and implementer agreements may restrict the _IfcRamp_ being an assembly to not have an independent shape representation, but to always require that the decomposed parts have a shape representation. In this case, at least the 'Body' geometric representations shall not be provided directly at _IfcRamp_ if it is an assembly. The 'Body' geometric representation of the _IfcRamp_ is then the sum of the 'Body' shape representation of the parts within the decomposition structure.

> HISTORY  New entity in IFC2.0.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Predefined generic types for a ramp that are specified in an enumeration. There may be a property set given for the predefined types.
> NOTE  The _PredefinedType_ shall only be used, if no _IfcRampType_ is assigned, providing its own _IfcRampType.PredefinedType_.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The attribute has been renamed from _ShapeType_ and changed to be OPTIONAL with upward compatibility for file based exchange.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcRampType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no ramp type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcRampType_.

## Concepts

### Axis 2D Geometry

The walking line is represented by a two-dimensional open curve as the axis. The curve is directed into the upward direction (direction has to be interpreted as specified at the subtypes of _IfcCurve_).

> NOTE  The 'Axis' representation of _IfcRamp_ may be provided even if the _IfcRamp_ has components with own shape representations.

### Body Clipping Geometry



### Body SweptSolid Geometry

If the _IfcRamp_ has no components defined (empty set of _SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy_) then the _IfcRamp_ 'Body' geometry may be represented by an own _IfcShapeRepresentation_.

### Element Decomposition

If the _IfcRamp_ has components (referenced by _SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy_) then no independent 'Body' geometric representation shall be defined for the _IfcRamp_. The _IfcRamp_ is then geometrically represented by the geometric representation of its components.

Figure 253 — Ramp placement

> EXAMPLE  Figure 253 illustrates _IfcRamp_ defining the local placement for all components.

#### IfcRampFlight

Ramps may be decomposed into ramp flights.

#### IfcSlab

Ramps may be decomposed into ramp landing, represented by _IfcSlab.PredefinedType_=LANDING

#### IfcRailing

Ramps may be decomposed into railings.

### Material Single

The material of the _IfcRamp_ is defined by the _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

Material information can also be given at the _IfcRampType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcRampType.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_ to _IfcMaterial_. If both are given, then the material directly assigned to _IfcRamp_ overrides the material assigned to _IfcRampType_.

### Object Typing



### Product Local Placement

The following restriction may be imposed by view definitions or implementer agreements:

* If the _IfcRamp_ establishes an aggregate, then all contained elements shall be placed relative to the _IfcRamp.ObjectPlacement_.

### Property Sets for Objects



### Spatial Containment

The _IfcRamp_, as any subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_, may participate alternatively in one of the two different containment relationships:

* the _Spatial Containment_ (defined here), or
* the _Element Composition_.

#### IfcBuildingStorey

Default spatial container

#### IfcBuilding

Spatial container for the element if it cannot be assigned to a building storey

#### IfcSite

Spatial container for the element in case that it is placed on site (outside of building)
