# IfcRampFlightType

The building element type _IfcRampFlightType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of ramp flights. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
<!-- end of definition -->
It is used to define a ramp flight type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The _IfcRampFlightType_ may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of _IfcRampFlightType_ are represented by instances of _IfcRampFlight_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcRampFlight_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
