# IfcRoofType

The building element type _IfcRoofType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of roofs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
<!-- end of definition -->
It is used to define a roof type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The _IfcRoofType_ may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of _IfcRoofType_ are represented by instances of _IfcRoof_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcRoof_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
