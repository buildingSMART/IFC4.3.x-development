# IfcShadingDeviceType

The building element type _IfcShadingDeviceType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of shading devices. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a shading device type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The _IfcShadingDeviceType_ may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of _IfcShadingDeviceType_ are represented by instances of _IfcShadingDevice_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcShadingDevice_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
