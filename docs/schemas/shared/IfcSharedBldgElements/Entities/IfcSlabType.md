# IfcSlabType

The element type _IfcSlabType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of slabs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a slab specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Slab types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

The occurrences of the _IfcSlabType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcSlab_.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The material assignment, if provided using the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship, shall not reference the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. Use _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ instead.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a slab element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Layer Set

The material of the _IfcSlabType_ is defined by the
_IfcMaterialLayerSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_
and attached by the
_IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.RelatingMaterial. It is
accessible by the inverse HasAssociations relationship.

The shared material layer set definition is defined by assigning
an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ (see material use definition above).
The _IfcMaterialLayer_ refers to one or several of
_IfcMaterial_ that is the common for all slab occurrence, if
used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTEÂ  Since each individual instance of
> _IfcSlab_ defines its own
> _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ including the offset from the
> reference plane, the same _IfcSlabType_ can be used
> independently of the reference plane alignment of its
> occurrences.
