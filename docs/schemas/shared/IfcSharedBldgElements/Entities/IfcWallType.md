# IfcWallType

The element type _IfcWallType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of walls. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations
<!-- end of definition -->
It is used to define a wall specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Wall types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

Occurrences of the _IfcWallType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcWall_. Occurrences of the _IfcWallType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_, or its applicable subtypes.

**Informal Propositions**

1. The material assignment, if provided using the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship, shall not reference the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. Use _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ instead.

## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined types of a wall element from which the type required may be set.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
The inherited attribute _ElementType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

## Concepts

### Material Layer Set

The material of the _IfcWallType_ is defined by the
_IfcMaterialLayerSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_
and attached by the
_IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. It is
accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_
relationship.

The shared material layer set definition is defined by
assigning an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ (see material use
definition above). The _IfcMaterialLayer_ refers to one or
several of _IfcMaterialLayer_ that is the common for all
wall occurrence, if used. If an _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is used, all occurrences must have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

> NOTEÂ  Since each individual instance of
> _IfcWall_ defines its own
> _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ including the offset from the
> wall axis, the same _IfcWallType_ can be used independently
> of the axis alignment of its occurrences.
