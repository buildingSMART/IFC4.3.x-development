## Comments

### Roll

Relative to the global Z direction for all beams that are non-vertical in regard to the global coordinate system (Profile direction equals global Z is Roll = 0.)

The shape information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In cases of inconsistency between the geometric parameters and the shape properties, provided in the attached property, the geometric parameters take precedence. For geometry editing applications, like CAD: this value should be write-only.

Note: new property in IFC4
