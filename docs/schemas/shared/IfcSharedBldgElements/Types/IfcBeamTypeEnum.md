## Items

### BEAM
A standard beam usually used horizontally.

### JOIST
A beam used to support a floor or ceiling.

### HOLLOWCORE
A wide often prestressed beam with a hollow-core profile that usually serves as a slab component.

### LINTEL
A beam or horizontal piece of material over an opening (e.g. door, window).

### SPANDREL
A tall beam placed on the facade of a building. One tall side is usually finished to provide the exterior of the building. Can be used to support joists or slab elements on its interior side.

### T_BEAM
A beam that forms part of a slab construction and acts together with the slab which it carries. Such beams are often of T-shape (therefore the English name), but may have other shapes as well, e.g. an L-Shape or an Inverted-T-Shape.

### GIRDER_SEGMENT
A segment of a girder (e.g. each span of a continuous girder).

### DIAPHRAGM
End portion of a girder transmitting loads to supports and providing moment resistance to adjoining segment.

### PIERCAP
A transversal beam on top of a pier (on a single column or extending from one column of a pier to another column of the same pier).

### HATSTONE
A beam on top of a retaining wall or a wing wall, preventing earth movement.

### CORNICE
A non-loadbearing beam on the longitudinal edge of bridge slab, usually encasing installations.

### EDGEBEAM
A beam on the longitudinal edge of bridge slab, usually concrete, providing additional stiffening and protection from the elements.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined linear beam element.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined linear beam element.
