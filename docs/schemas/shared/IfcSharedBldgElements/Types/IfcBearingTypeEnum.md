The bearing functionality is provided by cylinder in a concave cylinder.

### SPHERICAL
The bearing functionality is provided by convex dome in a concave basin.

A pad bearing which carries vertical load by contact stresses between a sheet of sliding material and a mating surface that permits movements by sliding and accommodates rotation by deformation of the elastomer.

### POT
A bearing which carries vertical load by compression of an (elastomeric) disc confined in a (steel) cylinder and which accommodates rotations by deformations of the disc.

### GUIDE
A bearing that ensures that the structure maintains the correct location or expansion/contraction path and takes no vertical load. Includes also restraint bearings.

### ROCKER
The bearing functionality is provided by a rocker construction. Includes line rocker and point rocker bearings.

### ROLLER
The bearing functionality is provided by one or more rollers that are placed between two plates.
