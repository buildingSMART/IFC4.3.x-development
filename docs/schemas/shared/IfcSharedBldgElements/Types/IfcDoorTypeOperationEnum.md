# IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum

This enumeration defines the basic ways to describe how an _IfcDoor_ or _IfcDoorType_ operate, as shown in the figures below. It combines the partitioning of the access barrier into single or multiple panels and the operation types of those panels.

In the most common case of swinging doors the _IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum_ defined the hinge side (left hung or right hung) and the opening direction (opening to the left, opening to the right). Whether the door opens inwards or outwards is determined by the local coordinate system of the _IfcDoor_

> NOTE  There are different definitions in various countries on what a left opening or left hung or left swing door is (same for right). Therefore the IFC definition terms may derive from the local standard and may need to be mapped appropriately.

> HISTORY  New Enumeration in IFC4.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE The new _IfcDoorTypeOperationEnum_ replaces the use of _IfcDoorStyleOperationEnum_ that is deprecated from IFC4 onwards.

Note that:

1. Figures are shown in the ground view.
2. Figures (symbolic representation) depend on the national building code.
3. These figures/ are only shown as illustrations, the actual representation in the ground view might differ.
4. Open to the outside is declared as open into the direction of the positive y-axis, determined by the _ObjectPlacement_ at _IfcDoor_
5. The location of the panel relative to the wall thickness is defined by theÂ _ObjectPlacement_ at _IfcDoor_, and the _IfcDoorLiningProperties.LiningOffset_ parameter.
