# IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum

This enumeration defines the basic configuration of the window type in terms of the number of window panels and the subdivision of the total window. The window configurations are given for windows with one, two or three panels (including fixed panels).<!-- end of definition -->

Windows which are subdivided into more than three panels have to be defined by the geometry only. The type of such windows is USERDEFINED.

> HISTORY New Enumeration in IFC4. The new _IfcWindowTypePartitioningEnum_ replaces the use of _IfcWindowStyleOperationEnum_ that is deprecated from IFC4 onwards.

Note:

1. The way how each panel operates is defined at the _IfcWindowPanelProperties.OperationType_.
2. The reference from the window panel to the location of that panel in the window style configuration is handled by the _IfcWindowPanelProperties.PanelPosition_.
3. The figures/ are shown as elevations in the XZ plane of the local placement of the window, looking into the direction of the positive Y axis.
4. These figures/ are only shown as illustrations
