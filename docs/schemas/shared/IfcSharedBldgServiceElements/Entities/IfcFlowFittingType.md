# IfcFlowFittingType

The element type _IfcFlowFittingType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow fitting and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow fitting specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).<!-- end of definition -->

A flow fitting type is used to define the common properties of a flow fitting that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow fitting is a device that is used to interconnect flow segments or other fittings within a distribution system, such as a tee in a ducted system that branches flow into two directions, or a junction box in an electrical distribution system. Flow fitting types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcFlowFittingType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowFitting_ or its subtypes.
