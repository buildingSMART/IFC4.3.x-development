# IfcFlowTerminalType

The element type _IfcFlowTerminalType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow terminal and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow terminal specification (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
<!-- end of short definition -->

A flow terminal type is used to define the common properties of a flow terminal that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow terminal acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system. Flow terminal types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcFlowTerminalType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowTerminal_ or its subtypes.
