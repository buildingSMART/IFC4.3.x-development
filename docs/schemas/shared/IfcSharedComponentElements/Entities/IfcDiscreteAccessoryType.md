# IfcDiscreteAccessoryType

The element component type **IfcDiscreteAccessoryType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of discrete accessories. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements
<!-- end of short definition -->

It is used to define a discrete accessory type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcDiscreteAccessoryType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcDiscreteAccessoryType** are represented by instances of _IfcDiscreteAccessory_.
