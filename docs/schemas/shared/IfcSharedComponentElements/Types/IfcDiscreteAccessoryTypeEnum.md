## Items

### ANCHORPLATE
An accessory consisting of a steel plate, shear stud connectors or welded-on rebar which is embedded into the surface of a concrete element so that other elements can be welded or bolted onto it later.

### BRACKET
An L-shaped or similarly shaped accessory attached in a corner between elements to hold them together or to carry a secondary element.

### SHOE
A column shoe or a beam shoe (beam hanger) used to support or secure an element.

### EXPANSION_JOINT_DEVICE
Assembly connection element between construction elements to allow for thermic differential expansions.

### FILLER
Sealant, gap filler rod, packing material or other used to close a gap.

### FLASHING
Construction material used to manage the passage of water around objects.

### CABLEARRANGER
A cable arranger is a flexible accessory or a part of a component placed around cables to arrange and minimize flexing of them at the point where it is placed.

### INSULATOR
A device designed to support and insulate a conductive element.
Note: definition from IEC 151-15-39.

### LOCK
A lock is a mechanical or electronic fastening device that is released either by a physical object (e.g., key, fingerprint, RFID card, security token etc.), by supplying secret information (e.g., number permutation, password), or by a combination thereof.

### TENSIONINGEQUIPMENT
An equipment used to maintain the tension of conductors or cables.

### RAILPAD
A non-metallic pad placed between rail and baseplate or rail and sleeper, bearer or slab.
Note: definition from EN 13481-1.

### SLIDINGCHAIR
A component which supports and retains the stock rail and a flat surface upon which the foot of the switch rail slides.

### RAIL_LUBRICATION
A device that prevents wearing of the rails throughout the flange of wheel to reduce noise emissions. It is often located at inner side of the outer rail in a curve or near turnouts (depends on function wearing or noise reduction).

### PANEL_STRENGTHENING
A component that minimizes pump effects of the substructure.

### RAILBRACE
A rail component that prevents rails from tipping and twisting.

### ELASTIC_CUSHION
A track elastic cushion is a kind of layer set on grooved sides of a concrete base, which is used for mitigating the impact of longitudinal and lateral load on track structures. A track elastic cushion shall only appear in ballastless track structures.

### SOUNDABSORPTION
A component in the track for sound absorption and may also absorb vibrations. It is often used in combination with slab tracks.

### POINTMACHINEMOUNTINGDEVICE
Point machine mounting device.

### POINT_MACHINE_LOCKING_DEVICE
Point machine locking device.

### RAIL_MECHANICAL_EQUIPMENT
A rail mechanical equipment is a mechnical equipment installed at railside, like blocking device, speed regulator, bias loaded inspector, track scale or controllable retarder.

### BIRDPROTECTION
A device that prevents a sitting down of birds at electrically critical points and thus birds are protected against electrical shocks and disturbances by short circuit are avoided.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined accessory.

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined accessory.
