# IfcGeomodel

Representation of the concept of a volumetric geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement.
<!-- end of short definition -->

The assembly may contain one of more strata and other anthropic elements. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from polyhedra or surfaces if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.

> NOTE This IfcElement subtype is an anomaly in the sense that it does not have a PredefinedType attribute. This is to be provided in subsequent versions of the standard.
