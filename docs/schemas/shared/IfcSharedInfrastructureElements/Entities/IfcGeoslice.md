# IfcGeoslice

Representation of the concept of a sectional planar geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement. The assembly may contain one of more strata and anthropic elements. The contained subtypes of _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ will have shape representations made from polygons reflecting the visible section or poly lines if a 'Yabuki' top surface model is being used.

> NOTE This IfcElement subtype is an anomaly in the sense that it does not have a PredefinedType attribute. This is to be provided in subsequent versions of the standard.
