# IfcGeotechnicalAssembly

Representation of the abstract concept of a geological and geotechnical model, usually an interpretation but sometimes created direct from ground penetrating measurement.
Use of an assembly is optional but can carry the methodology and uncertainty information.
Such assemblies will include _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_ entity types and may include other entity types such as _IfcPile_, _IfcSlab_ or _IfcSensor_ to represent the capping, lining or logging equipment present.
_IfcBorehole_ or _IfcGeoslice_  can have a physical reality as a construction hazard alongside being the carrier for the interpreted results. Geological hazards may be associated to any _IfcGeotechnicalAssembly_ or _IfcGeotechnicalStratum_.
