# IfcGeotechnicalStratum

Representation of the concept of an identified discrete almost homogeneous geological feature with either an irregular solid or 'Yabuki' top surface shape or a regular voxel cubic shape. A stratum is represented as a discrete entity, specialised (sub typed) from _IfcElement_. A stratum may be broken down into smaller entities if properties vary across the stratum or alternatively properties may be described with bounded numeric ranges. A stratum may carry information about the physical form and its interpretation as a Geological Item (GML).

The shape representations used should correspond to the sub-type of _IfcGeotechnicalAssembly_ in which it occurs
