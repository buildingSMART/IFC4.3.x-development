## Attributes

### PredefinedType
Identifies the predefined type of a pavement element. This type may associate additional specific property sets.
NOTE The PredefinedType shall only be used, if no IfcPavementType is assigned, providing its own IfcCourseType.PredefinedType.

## Formal Propositions

### CorrectPredefinedType
Either the _PredefinedType_ attribute is unset (e.g. because an _IfcPavementType_ is associated), or the inherited attribute _ObjectType_ shall be provided, if the _PredefinedType_ is set to USERDEFINED.

### CorrectTypeAssigned
Either there is no type object associated, i.e. the _IsTypedBy_ inverse relationship is not provided, or the associated type object has to be of type _IfcPavementType_.
