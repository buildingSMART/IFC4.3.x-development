# IfcSign

A sign is a notice on display that gives information or instructions in a written, symbolic or other form. Signs are passive with the most common form of a pictorial panel. An instance of _IfcSign_ refers to the occurrence of an individual panel which can be applied to a surface such as a wall or be aggregated within a Signal Assembly which can include multiple sign occurrences and the associated supporting structural elements (see Signal Assembly for examples).<!-- end of definition -->
