### DAMPINGSYSTEM
An elastic element inserted between the superstructure (track and plate on slab track or ballast bed with ballast inserted in) and the tunnel structure (tunnel floor). Some of the elastic elements have a partial decoupling effect between the superstructure and underground due to vibrations. Both helical springs and elastomer blocks or elastomer strips can be used as suspension systems.

### FENDER
A passive or active device formed of a damper and impact panel that is mounted on the quayside to protect against vessel impact.
