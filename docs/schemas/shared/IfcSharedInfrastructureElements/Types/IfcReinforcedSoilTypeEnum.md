<!-- end of short definition -->

## Items

### SURCHARGEPRELOADED
A method that applies load to the foundation to discharge pore water, and the foundation is consolidated to improve the foundation strength. Unloading when the carrying capacity reaches the required level.

### VERTICALLYDRAINED
A method to set vertical drainage measures in the foundation, so that pore water in the soil is discharged and the foundation strength is improved.

### DYNAMICALLYCOMPACTED
The method of using dynamic tamping machine usually free falling a heavy hammer from the height, compacting the soil and quickly improving the bearing capacity of the foundation.

### REPLACED
Dig out the soft soil in a certain range below the foundation ground and then backfill the area with high strength, low compressibility and no corrosive materials.

### ROLLERCOMPACTED
A kind of compacting method that adopts rolling machinery, repeated rolling and vibration compacts the foundation soil, increasing strength and descreasing compressibility.

### GROUTED
A method of injecting curable slurry into cracks or pores of a geotechnical foundation to improve its physical and mechanical properties.

### USERDEFINED
User-defined type

### NOTDEFINED
Undefined type.
