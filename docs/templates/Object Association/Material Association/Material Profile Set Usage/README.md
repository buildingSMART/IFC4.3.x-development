Material Profile Set Usage
==========================

Material profile set usage defines layout at occurrences to indicate the offset from the 'Axis' reference curve according to cardinal point, and a reference extent such as for a default column height.

The concept of _Material Profile Set Usage_ is only applicable to certain product subtypes, referred to as "standard case" elements. It supports a certain range of parametric definitions for those element configurations.

The material of those standard case elements is defined by _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ and is attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship. Standard case elements with composite profiles can be represented by referring to several _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ that is referenced from the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.
