Material Profile Set
====================

Material profile sets are associated with products or product types where materials are placed in cross-sections of specified dimensions following a path defined at occurrences of the type. Examples of such products are beams, columns, members, reinforcing, footings, piles, pipe segments, duct segments, and cable segments.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Material profile sets can be provided at the _IfcColumnType_, defining the common material information for all occurrences of the same column type.Â It is then accessible by the inverse _IsTypedBy_ relationship at _IfcColumn_ pointing to _IfcColumnType_ having the _HasAssociations_ inverse relationship to _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ with _RelatingMaterial_ referring to the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_>. If an individual material association is provide at the _IfcColumn_ and the _IfcColumnType_, then the material directly assigned to _IfcColumn_ overrides the material assigned to _IfcColumnType_.
