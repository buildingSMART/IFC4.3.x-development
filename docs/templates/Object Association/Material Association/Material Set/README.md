Material Set
============

Composite or multiple materials may be described using a material set. There are three types of material sets to choose from:

 * Layer sets - layered materials with a thickness that fills a boundary
 * Profile sets - when materials are extruded along a profiled shape
 * Constituent sets - when materials are either homogeneously mixed, or arbitrarily placed

> EXAMPLE A wall or slab may use a layer set. A beam, column, pipe, or duct may use a profile set, even if it only has one profile. Composite beams may be made out of multiple profiles. Concrete may use a constituent set for portions of sand and cement. A window frame may also use a constituent set for one material for its frame and another material for its glazing portion.

The material is defined by either _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, or _IfcMaterialConstituentSet_ and related using _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.RelatingMaterial. Independent of the material used, each layer, profile, or constituent within the set may be identified using a name and category.
