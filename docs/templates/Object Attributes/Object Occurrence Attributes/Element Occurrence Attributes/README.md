Element Occurrence Attributes
=============================

Physical elements may be further identified via the _Tag_ attribute. This is a human readable identifier such as an element or item numbe. While there is no restriction on usage of such tags, it is recommended the _Tag_ is unique within its containing scope.

```
concept {
    IfcElement:Tag -> IfcIdentifier
}
```
