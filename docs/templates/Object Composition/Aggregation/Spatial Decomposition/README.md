Spatial Decomposition
=====================

Provision of a spatial structure of the project by aggregating spatial elements. The spatial structure is a hierarchical tree of spatial elements ultimately assigned to the project. Decomposition refers to the relationship to a lower level element (e.g. this storey has spaces or this road has road segments).

> NOTE  The link between the project and the highest level spatial element is provided by this concept through _IfcRelAggregates_ and not through declaration using _IfcRelDeclares_. This is a known anomaly introduced to maintain compatibility with earlier versions of this standard.

The project spatial structure may be made up of a selection of different spatial structure elements with the most generic and simplest form from low to high level as follows: _IfcSpace_, _IfcFacilityPart_ (or _IfcBuildingStorey_ in the case of buildings), _IfcFacility_ (or any of its subtypes), _IfcSite_ and  _IfcProject_ with _IfcSite_, _FacilityPart_ and _IfcSpace_ being optional levels. Therefore a spatial structure element should only be part of an element at the same or higher level, with the exception of _IfcFacility_ which can be part of an _IfcFacilityPart_ to allow for the regional or longitudinal division of a high level facility in to sections which can then contain one or more smaller functional facilities.

Where possible the relevant subtype of _IfcFacility_ should be used to describe the spatial structure element in question. When a adequate subtype of _IfcFacility_ with predefined or user defined type is not available the higher level, generic _IfcFacility_ entity can be instantiated with the relevant and agreed typing identifier defined in _IfcFacility.ObjectType_. This allows for nearly full coverage of built environment domains and/or scenarios that have yet to be addressed with specific extensions.

In addition to the identified spatial structure elements _IfcSpatialZone_ can be used to provide cross domain or functional zones within a project, these elements are included into the hierarchy using the _Spatial Containment_ concept (_IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_) and can be aggregated into a functional hierarchy in the same manner as other spatial structure elements with the constraint that an _IfcSpatialZone_ can only be composed under another _IfcSpatialZone_.

```
concept {
    IfcObjectDefinition:IsDecomposedBy -> IfcRelAggregates:RelatingObject
    IfcRelAggregates:RelatedObjects -> IfcSpatialElement
    IfcSpatialElement:Name -> IfcLabel
    IfcRelAggregates:RelatedObjects[binding="RelatedObjects"]
    IfcSpatialElement:Name[binding="SpatialElementName"]
}
```
