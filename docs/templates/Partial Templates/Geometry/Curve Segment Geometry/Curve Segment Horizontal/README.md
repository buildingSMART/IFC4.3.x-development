Curve Segment Horizontal
==============

The enumeration of curve segments intended for use in the context of an IfcCompositeCurve representing horizontal alignment geometry.

```
concept {
    IfcCurveSegment -> Arc_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Bloss_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Clothoid_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Cosine_Spiral_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Cubic_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Helmert_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Linear_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Sine_Spiral_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Viennese_Bend_Transition_Segment
}
```
