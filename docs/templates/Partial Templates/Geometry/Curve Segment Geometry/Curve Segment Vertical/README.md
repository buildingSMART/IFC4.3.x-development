Curve Segment Vertical
==============

The enumeration of curve segments intended for use in the context of an IfcGradientCurve representing vertical alignment geometry.

```
concept {
    IfcCurveSegment -> Arc_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Clothoid_Transition_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Linear_Segment
    IfcCurveSegment -> Parabolic_Transition_Segment
}
```
