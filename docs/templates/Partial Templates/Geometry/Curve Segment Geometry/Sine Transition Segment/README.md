Sine Transition Segment
=======================

The sine transition segment is a special case of a spiral where the curvature rate of change is a sine function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The values of its individual terms are identical and equal to the length of the segment L:
SineTerm = L
LinearTerm = L

    IfcCurveSegment:ParentCurve -> IfcSine
    IfcCurveSegment:SegmentStart -> IfcParameterValue_0
    IfcCurveSegment:SegmentLength -> IfcParameterValue_1
    IfcSine:SineTerm -> IfcLengthMeasure_0
    IfcSine:LinearTerm -> IfcLengthMeasure_1
}
```
