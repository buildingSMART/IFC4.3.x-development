Set Of Survey Points
====================

Geometry representation of a set of survey points. They can be 2D points or 3D points. The set of points may not form a closed surface or a survey line.

> NOTE  When a single _IfcAnnotation_ is represented by multiple survey points, it is not possible to associate properties to the single geometrical points of the set, but only to the whole annotation.
