Project Library Information
===========================

Projects may define libraries holding revisions of the project such as model servers or databases. Multiple libraries may be referenced to indicate multiple revisions, multiple branches, and/or multiple servers.

If _IfcLibraryInformation_ is provided, the project must be retrievable (provided the user has access permissions) using values as follows:

IfcLibraryInformation | HTTP Header | Description
----------------------|-------------|------------
Location | / | fully qualified URL for retrieving (or updating) the project in the content type specified
Version | ETag | version stamp for qualifying a particular version, in a format specific to the server, which may be sorted by ordinal for comparison
VersionDate | Last-Modified | UTC date and time of file as recorded on server
Publisher | (username) | the account handle submitting a project revision is identified by the _Identification_ of _IfcPerson_


The following standard HTTP operations may be supported by a server (in addition to any extended operations) for retrieving or updating such data given access rights:

HTTP | Description
-----|------------
OPTIONS | Determine the available HTTP operations.
HEAD | Determine the latest version of a project without downloading it.
GET | Download the latest version of a project (or specific version with ETag provided).
PUT | Replace the project, clearing any version history. Servers may reject or otherwise modify such submitted content.
POST | Upload a new version of a project, appending to version history. Servers may reject, merge, or otherwise modify such submitted content.
DELETE | Delete the project.


The following standard MIME types may be supported by a server (in addition to any proprietary formats) for uploading and downloading data for use in the HTTP Accept header:

MIME Type | Format
----------|-------
application/xml | IFC-XML
application/step | IFC-SPF
