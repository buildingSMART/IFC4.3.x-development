This specification consists of a schema defining data types, along with common concepts indicating use of data types for particular scenarios. This chapter defines such common concepts, which are applied at entities having specific use. Such concepts also form the basis of model views, which are supplementary specifications that adapt the scope of this schema for targeted use of the IFC standard for specific levels of advancement in usage.

Each concept template defines a graph of entities and attributes and parameters for particular attributes and instance types. Various entities within this schema reference such concept templates and adapt them for particular use according to parameters.

> EXAMPLE  The 'Ports' concept template defines distribution system connectivity for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; a pipe segment defines an application of the 'Ports' concept, having one port as an inlet and another as an outlet.
